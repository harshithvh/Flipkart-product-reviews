# About

---

Product reviews is an essential part of an online store like Flipkart’s branding and marketing. They help to build trust and loyalty and typically describe what sets your product apart from others. Savvy shoppers almost never purchase a product without knowing how it’s going to work for them. The more reviews a platform has, the more convinced a user will be that he/she is making the right decision.

Online reviews are very important to e-commerce businesses because they ultimately increase sales by giving the consumers the information they need to make the decision to purchase the product. One other important factor in elevating the reputation, standard, and evaluation of an e-commerce store is product rating.
