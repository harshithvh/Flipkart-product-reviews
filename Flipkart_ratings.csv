Exactly after 2 yr coverage window provided by my Citibank card, clever engineers. The other 3 Foscam cameras are going strong, the 2 older/lower res models after 3 yrs.

Cons: - Not powered directly through ethernet. - BIG PROBLEM: Anytime the cameras sensor is exposed to any light remotely bright (IE; sidewalk on a sunny day) the camera freezes and reboots. This is NOT an isolated problem and has yet to be fixed. Do yourself a favor and find another option for the money.  UPDATE August 22, 2015: I updated the firmware as requested, and the camera still freezes and reboots when the camera sees a bright light. I cannot and will not ever recommend this camera until Foscam decides to do the right thing and recall of these cameras that are affected and replace them free of charge.

Prior to this camera, I had no idea what port forwarding was or any idea how to setup a webcam. Despite this, I went ahead and purchased this camera, and so far I have not been disappointed.<br /><br />I purchased this camera recently for use as a baby cam. I was initially apprehensive due to all of the cautionary reviews on here regarding the difficulty of set up. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not that difficult to set up for both home network viewing, as well as outside viewing from a DDNS site. For home viewing, the setup CD included with the camera was easy to get the camera up and running.<br /><br />For external viewing, the Youtube video by AwkwardHamster was excellent. I followed this video and easily created my own site for remote viewing. Picture quality is good, and the sound is ok. The two way audio leaves a lot to be desired, but from my limited experience shopping around, the price more than makes up for this camera's shortcomings.",07-08-2015

It is an H.264 Series camera, giving better compression ratios than the MPEG variety.<br /><br />Foscam cameras generally seem to be of high quality, but for me at least, the firmware updating procedure is somewhat difficult.  None of the firmware updates are dated, but rather cryptic version numbers.  For instance for my FI9821W V2, the latest firmware update is 2.x.1.119, and it says &#34;At least 2.x.2.8 is required to update to 2.x.1.119&#34;.<br /><br />When I look at my camera, the Application Firmware Version is 2.21.1.143<br />and my System Firmware Version  1.5.2.11<br /><br />Okay, you tell me if my firmware is old, or new.....

If you just want it as a baby monitor there's no need for Internet access.

I didn't want to pay a couple hundred for a camera that would be in the garage so I got this one.<br /><br />The camera is great!  The pan/tilt is amazing and I can see everything.  I'm taking off a star because the audio is a little weak.  The picture is not super clear but you should already know that from the specs.<br /><br />I'm not taking off stars for setting it up, but this is amazingly hard.  Like WOW, hard.  You should probably be a Rocket Scientist if you want to do it on your own.  Wow wow wow!  I let my pride waste over 10 hours of my life trying to set it up on my own.  I could not get the port forwarding to work so I could only see it at home.  I watched several youtube videos and read forums and blah blah blah.  I even watched some kids video on youtube about my router, I was determined to set this up myself.  Wow, impossible. Finally called for help and the tech help was great.  Walter? (I'm bad at remembering names) was able to fix it very quickly and now all is good.  I'm not ashamed to say I needed Tech help because OMG this is super hard and impossible to do on your own.<br /><br />My problem with port forwarding was this: I have a Netgear router and I set up everything like they tell you on the forums and FAQ, etc.  I checked my ports via port checking websites and they all said my port was not open.  What I didn't think about was I have cable internet and my modem has a built in router that I have never used.  You can work with your router all day long but it won't work if you don't also change settings in your cable/dsl/etc modem!

The camera was sporting the new version.<br /><br />Unfortunately once my login cookie expired I was permanently locked out of the camera. The reasoning is as follows: because my old password doesn't meet their new password requirements, which by the way, are arbitrary and awful, it won't log me in.<br /><br />Here's a summary of how the login code works: grab username from input, grab password from input, make sure that the entered password meets the following regex: /((?=.*\d)(?=.*\D)|(?=.*[a-zA-Z])(?=.*[^a-zA-Z]))^.{6,12}$/<br />For the lazy that means it will reject a password of '$5rlK4vZIr 8.#k' but thinks 'Password1' is just great.<br /><br />...

We are very pleased.  The set-up is not as intuitive as a baby monitor, since it requires plugging it in to a PC to add the wireless network configuration and some security settings (user/password, which you should always change as Foscam's default passwords were infamously made public by hackers some time ago).  Once it is working, it does its job. You can access it from any PC connected to the same network, move it around, enable/diable night vision, etc. You can even ask for emails to be sent upon movement/sound detection. Foscam itself offers a DNS system so you can access your cam at a pre-determined web address from anywhere in the world! (or disable such feature if you are privacy concerned). I found that feature useful when we went away for a trip and used the camera at the front window to monitor traffic from/to the house (I was expecting valuable packages to be delivered while away!).  As a baby monitor we use it together with TinyCam Monitor (Pro) app on our Android phones, and it works like a charm. We can check whether the baby is asleep without having to enter the room and risk waking him up.

This however, is apparently impossible to set up if you don't know anything about DDNS, port forwarding and a million other foreign topics and acronyms. After spending hours and hours trying to learn all of this jargon and attempting to fix all the appropriate settings I still cannot figure it out. The user manual is not at all helpful because there are too many different products out there for them to cover.  Plus, you have to adjust settings on multiple devices and websites and for someone who doesn't know computers or the inner workings of the internet it is nearly impossible to figure out.  First there is your internet service provider settings, then your router settings, then the camera settings, then you have to set up a new account on some website like no-ip, which I can't figure out how to use even after reading all their FAQs and customer support sections. Then there is your firewall and after researching that I still have no idea how to stop that from blocking my camera.

In addition, I purchased product as new and it was clear that the product shipped was used.  The products already had names on them!

At first I though this was better as it seemed to offer more settings, but after setting it up to deliver images via Gmail I noticed a terrible flaw. Unlike the Tenvis, which will send a continuous flow of images to your email account when the camera detects motion, this Foscam model only sends 6 images right away, and then sends nothing for about a minute. During this time, you could potentially be missing out on important action that you want to see.<br /><br />Scanning the Foscam forums, it would seem the only way to get around this is to set up FTP, but that would be quite an inconvenience for several reasons, the main being that I don't see an easy way of getting free online ftp hosting and a local ftp server is out of the question.<br /><br />I also noticed the picture quality of the emailed images was poorer compared to the Tenvis.<br /><br />Perhaps the Foscam is better in some other respects compared to the competition, but for my needs it's a no-brainer to stick with the cheaper Tenvis.",13-06-2015

The only problem is when light is around the point that the photocell will activate/deactivate the LEDs. The camera will toggle the LEDs annoyingly every few minutes or so, which throw off automatic motion detection and leads to false events. The camera will go through a little cadence when it first powers up and then it will leave it pointing straight forward. I wish it would keep track of where it was pointed when it powers on and return to that position when it is done with it's initialization. I have to wait for it to go through its setup and then point it back to where it was previously before I can leave it unattended.<br /><br />Otherwise this is a great panning/zooming camera that easily works over wi-fi.

It was a little tricky at first but once I got it up and running through my web browser it was working just ok. Its not as clear as most other cameras I have seen. One problem I encountered when having this camera is that for some reason it tends to switch the URL camera address on me for no reason. I use some other program in order for it to record the front of my house. I have it enabled to record only when it picks up movement. Sometimes you can't even make out a person’s face. At the end of the day I would have spent the extra money to get a better quality camera. Also one last thing for some reason this camera always like to disconnect from my network and ill have to refresh it by unplugging then replugging the power then opening it up on my computer. I actually caught a robbery in progress in front of my house and wasn’t able to hand in footage to cops because the thing wasn’t connected.

It you're security conscious (as you likely are buying this camera) then please be aware you're putting your wifi network's (and every other connected device's) security at risk by installing these easily breached portals.  Likewise, the smartphone apps that provide access to uploaded images, etc. similarly expose your phone to intruders.  You can find more info on security risks and threats on the internet.<br />My recommendation is if you chose to use these security devices, you should consult with a professional networking expert before installing them - or, only use them within the network (do not connect them to the web, but only to a PC that's on the network as well).",23-05-2015

As an added advantage, any interaction/exchange between our dogs and people who shouldn't be where they are all get recorded in a very clear (not HD) video which protects the dogs and us from any legal repercussions.  The camera even recorded a delivery truck (with unit number, driver's face, and license plate) scraping the side of my car--which reduced the negotiations with the driver's insurance company to how quickly can you write the check.<br /><br />These cameras have already paid for themselves; and Foscam tech support is always available and easily reachable.

I did a “restore factory settings” after upgrading to 8.1 and completed all the following steps (tried to keep them sequential in order to be easy to follow as I found all this out through hours of research and trial and error): Exclude the Blue Iris folder (C:/Programs/BlueIris) in Anti-Virus software and if you can, also exclude the IP address for your camera(s) - (Avast – settings, troubleshooting, redirect setting, add URL). Complete any troubleshooting on the wireless network you are going to use for your cameras. I have 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands with different ssid (name); Foscam cameras work on 2.4 with b/g so I set that network for the cameras and use everything else on 5GHz band. Windows 8.1 renamed my Ethernet connection same as wireless; I found it easier just to rename my wireless networks in my router and reconnect my devices.  Update: There is a simple registry fix for this I've since found and used - google. Was having an issue with my wireless disconnecting and now it hasn’t for quite a while. Install IPCamera.exe to desktop and install IPCWebcomponents.exe (web plugin for Windows). Plug in camera power and then Ethernet cable to router. Double click IPCamera.exe tool on desktop and it should find your Foscam camera. Double click on your camera and install the plugin when prompted. Sign in (you’ll have to change your password).  Admin is login with no password. Choose Active X mode for IE. Probably have to re-log in after installing the plugin. Update: If you have problems installing the active x control: I added the camera IP address to IE's compatibility view, closed the browser, reopenedIE as administrator and typed camera url to log in rather than using the tool.  I was able to install active x and log on camera.  Logged on as usual since with no problems. Update System Firmware then application, and plugin (you’ll have to reinstall at next logon); follow instructions on Foscam support site; they’ll send you an email with all update after you go to the support page and enter your name and email.  Complete updates with Ethernet connection, not over wireless. Complete updates then log back in using IPCamera.exe tool on desktop. Once you can see your camera, then you can disconnect Ethernet and complete wireless. Go to settings and make any adjustments and remember to submit or save each change as you make them. You can change the name of your camera (I used location). Set time zone, sync to NTP server, set daylight savings if necessary and advance time 60’. Ensure a static IP address if you don’t want any problems.  It’s easy to do and, according to Foscam, it’s better to do it in the camera settings than in router settings….just uncheck “Obtain IP from DHCP Server” and change the last set of numbers in your IP address.  For example, 192.168.1.xxx to 192.168.1.x.  Your router IP address is probably something like 192.168.1.1 and if you look in your router settings you’ll see that your router will assign numbers from 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.265 or something close.  You’ll want to change your router settings to assign numbers from something like 192.168.1.11 to 192.168.1.265 so you can use the lower numbers (except for “1”) to assign to your camera(s).  That way you won’t have to worry about future conflicts with your router assigning your camera IP to another device. On your computer, use Windows Key and “R” (for “Run”), type cmd, then type ipconfig to get your Subnet Mask, Gateway, and DNS server. Change HTTP port to 8090 and any additional camera would be 8091, 8092, etc. Check the box for using wireless LAN and scan for your network; make sure the computer you are on is using the same network or you may have problems (I did and ended up fixing some network inefficiencies when doing troubleshooting on why my cameras kept going in and out).  Complete the network info and security key for the wireless network. I did select UPnP settings after reading a troubleshooting blog. For 8910W, I did disable “go to center on boot” in PT / PTZ settings so that my camera would not scan the room everytime it booted. For 9821P it’s under PTZ/Start-up Options – disable startup. After setting up camera and if setting up more than one Foscam camera then do select the other camera(s) in the multi-device section; the software will fill in all the blanks except logon and password – you’ll need to fill those in. I have mounted the Foscam FI8910W on my covered front porch so it’s protected from direct element and it’s been raining and humid almost non-stop; it is mounted up high and upside down so I had to flip the image in the camera software – find the setting just to the left of the video feed.  It’s been there about a month with no problems.  Used a much better mount (sold on Amazon) than what comes with the camera: VideoSecu 1/4&#34; x 20 Threads Swivel Security Camera Mount 2-6 Inch Adjustable Universal Pan Tilt CCTV Camera Mounting Bracket with Ceiling Clip 1BO. Mounted the FI8921P inside using the regular mount – it works fine.",19-05-2015

The audio is crisp, the night-time picture quality is great, and the price is excellent.  Also, this unit does not kill my wifi reception unlike most 2.4 Ghz baby monitors.<br /><br />Yes, this unit does have some limitations:<br /><br />First off, you have to be a tad technical to get it setup.  However, there are great guides that step you through the one-time setup process.  Make sure you change the default settings to add a strong password (especially if you set it up so you can view it while you are away).<br /><br />Secondly, the Foscam software is pretty bad.  Logging in to camera with Internet Explorer is pretty good (though, you may need to tweak your IE settings to run the ActiveX scrips).  However, logging in with Chrome requires an odd plug in if you want audio.  Logging in from an Andriod phone with the official Foscam app is a joke and did not work at all.  I tried about 3 other different third-party apps, all of which worked right away.  In the end, I ended up getting tinyCam Monitor PRO for $4 for Andriod which works very well (especially for audio).<br /><br />Third, the built in speaker is pretty horrible (but it does have a 3.5 mm audio out jack), but I don't see many people using this.<br /><br />Despite the limitations, the hardware is great.  The build quality is also pretty high.  I was mounting this to a tripod and accidentally dropped it 6 feet onto a hardware floor and it still works perfectly fine (there is only a small mark on the unit).",20-04-2015

Camera worked fine for about 5 months, with automatic alerts and remote access through the provided DDNS that came with the camera. Then suddenly, the DDNS shut down. I can't access it from anywhere. Tried contacting customer support, they said it must be the camera. I pinged the DDNS about a dozen times, no response, it's down. Not a single person in support was willing to look into the status of the DDNS which tells me that Foscam must be shutting these down to save money or push for paid tech support. I let them remote access my computer to try to fix it and they came up with nothing. The real kicker is that once customer support failed (because they wouldn't just fix the DDNS) I tried to set up port forwarding and just access it through my IP, still nothing. Whatever they did to my camera, nothing works now. The camera is essentially useless. No email updates, no remote viewing, it's just a lump of hardware sitting on my ceiling unless I feel like forking out $50 for a DDNS that was supposed to be included for the life of the camera, and now I'm not even sure that will work with whatever support did to its innards. 2 stars because the hardware is great, but it's a piece of junk as far as included online access features, which is the whole reason I bought it.",13-04-2015

Hardware build quality is solid. It works when logged into directly from the web browser. However, neither the box nor the website tells you that you must be running a Microsoft Windows PC to completely set this product up. You can remote into the camera from the IP address assigned by the router, but anything after that, to include use of the official Android app, will require a Windows plugin to set up (a happy .exe from FOSCAM's website).<br /><br />There are about ten different FOSCAM apps in the Google Play store, all from different publishers. The Android app linked from FOSCAM's website (blue cloud icon in the Play Store) absolutely WILL NOT connect to the camera, no matter what IP address/port combination you set up. The new app wants you to scan a QR code, which is nowhere to be found on the camera. The new app requires that you to register through the FOSCAM website and download an EXE which works as the intermediary for IP forwarding. There is no way to set this up manually in the new app. Come on. This is 2015. Why are we still requiring Windows to operate?<br /><br />For now, the only solution for remote viewing is to use your web browser (on the computer or phone is okay) and log directly into the webcam. You can also try one of the dozens of other webcam viewing apps from third parties, all of which work better than the official app. What a waste of a good product.",13-04-2015

They all worked BUT inconsistently.  What good is having security camera's if you have to reboot them by unplugging them or using the reboot button?  Try to do this while your away from home or on vacation.... so in my opinion (we are an apple family) these are NOT easy to work with.  On top of that- Foscam Customer service is piss poor.  You will NOT get any support from Foscam if you purchase through amazon.  They only support camera's purchased from their site.  I was told by a Foscam Representative that Amazon is an unauthorized seller of Foscam products.  (Go figure that one out)  I repeated this several times to the rep and he repeated it back to me - I even told him that I was going to hang up and call Amazon and basically that was the end of the conversation with Foscam.  Needless to say, I returned all the camera's based on Foscam support PLUS the inconsistency in the camera's reliability staying connected.  There has to be a newer upcoming company that can produce a better camera at a decent price point without comparing themselves to Foscam. ----<br /><br />UPDATE; I discovered on the apple site that they offer a camera called &quot;Canary&quot;- so I purchased one to try out....wow! what a difference. has everything build right in including a siren that you can activate remotely if necessary.  I purchased a 2nd one on Amazon (do like Amazon!) Needless to say, so far so great.  Now I'm continuing my search for a decently priced outdoor camera that maybe can pan, tilt, zoom, motion, send alerts... ummm- is this possible?  anyway, when I find it I will review and let you know.

Everything, literally everything, about this camera works wonderfully except the software. Virtually no software I could find, be it the iOS app provided from Foscam itself, or even a number of paid 3rd-party iOS apps that work with this camera and others from the App Store will play uninterrupted streaming video from the camera for very long. As others have reported on various internet forums, the video and audio steam starts up fine but after a period of time, the stream dies, and ends up leaving whatever app is playing it in a locked up state. This translates into having to manually reset/reload the video streaming app from your device every 10-15 minutes depending on when it decides to die out.<br /><br />It sounds like this problem is actually with the firmware software that streams video from the camera itself so if that is true, if they would update it and solve the issues, then this review could easily be 5-stars. Until then, I've returned my camera and have gone with a much more expensive Dropcam, which while it does all the same things that this camera does for a LOT more money, at least I can watch the video stream infinitely without having to notice the app needs to be restarted manually.",20-03-2015

Took a bit to set up mainly because of my particular configuration.  I wanted to be able to monitor on a phone or tablet, in house as a baby monitor and really wanted the audio.  I had a hard time getting an app that worked, it seems there are different apps for different Foscam cameras, then I had to find one that allowed audio.  Bottom line is it works good and was an interesting puzzle to get it doing what I wanted.  Using phone (on Wi-Fi) I can listen to audio from camera, have not tried to talk through the camera yet, and I can pan and tilt the camera.  Very happy with it.  It works wireless but I may hard wire it just to ensure there is no interference or connectivity issues.

It does have some issues with going in and out of NV mode depending on the light conditions and it is a little loud while making the changes.  That said the camera functions good and I have several of them around the house.  I use most of the features and have not experienced any issues with the Black cameras.  I also have one white and it has issues with lighting.  It will reset often and I believe this is due to light penetrating the case as it will constantly switch between NV on/off for a couple of minutes before restarting.  When I put it in a dark environment it works fine.<br /><br />I use one as a baby monitor and the sound pickup is better than any other monitors I have seen.  It sits about 15 feet away from the bed and I can hear my child breathing or any little sound.<br /><br />I would have given it a five star if not for the issue with my white camera.

Sure, the first thing the manufacturer will say in response is to update the firmware, but:<br />- That doesn't fix all security issues (connection is still unencrypted, for example)<br />- They make no effort of telling you that you need to update the firmware. It's posted in some obscure part of their site, but you don't get an email or anything like that if there is a firmware update.

We bought it to use as a baby monitor. It is a little larger than I realized, otherwise it is just what I expected. It was easy and straightforward to setup, the power adapter has a nice long cord on it and we have not yet had any connectivity issues (been running for about 2 months now). Status lights on the back were too bright for our children at night, but we solved that easily by covering them with electrical tape. The night-vision lights on the front are dim enough that they don't cause any issues. Setting up out-of-network access has proven to be much more difficult than the in-network setup. It is not an important feature to me, however, so after spending several days trying to get it to work I gave up on it. Overall I think the camera is well-priced for the quality.<br /><br />Note: I had heard there were some security concerns, but after checking into it I found that the main issues were resolved a while back with a firmware upgrade so I never had to worry about that.",24-02-2015

Recommend this as a baby monitor!  Returned my Dropcam!","I'm not a a tech guru but have set up a few wireless routers before.  The videos on Foscam's website guide you through the steps to set up the camera, connect it to your wireless router and do port forwarding.  They seem to be easier to follow and better than the instruction manual with the camera.  The installation CD includes setup for my Mac, and it is also available on Foscam's website.  I had no need to call tech support!  I'm using two of these with the &#34;Baby Monitor for IP Cameras&#34; iPhone/iPad app from Tiny Solutions LLC.  They work great and the app allows you to see more than one camera at once.  I have one camera connecting to a wireless router that's connected to the internet so I can access the camera from anywhere (it's password protected).  I have another camera set up in a second house on a wireless network, but I don't have internet access there so I only have access inside my home.  My wife thinks the quality of the daytime picture is better than the Dropcam (non Pro version) we returned, I think it's about the same.  The night vision is clearly better!  The delay on the Dropcam was about 5 seconds, with this it's only about 1 second.  This is likely due to the Dropcam sending their information out to their cloud service, then back to you (it won't work without an internet connection).  Pan/Tilt is slick and works with the app we use.  No baby yet so I haven't mounted the camera with the articulating mount included in the box.  Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great baby cam.",14-02-2015

The instructions make it pretty easy to understand even if you are not super-technical.  Some details are a bit vague as far as port forwarding and some other router configurations.  This is intentional as there are a lot of different types of networking hardware.  I would suggest you supplement the Foscam instructions with instructions from the manufacturer of your modem.<br /><br />That said, this is a great product for monitoring your house while you are away.  There are some more advanced options of recording that I don't utilize.  I mainly access it on my smart phone (&#34;Foscam ip camera app&#34; & &#34;CamViewer&#34; are the two apps I use after testing several - both free) and do have alerts setup via email during certain hours.  It works without a hitch.<br /><br />The interface does have a few bugs but nothing that does not have a work around.  Also, the sensitivity for alerts tends to be overly sensitive so that I get emails for clouds casting shade on the window or when the IR option comes on.<br /><br />I did a lot of research before purchasing this model so I got exactly what I expected in this machine.

Read instructions thoroughly first (and watch videos). Requires a static ip to view","A little tricky to set up -- took me several tries and several hours over a couple of weeks, as  I bought this in order to help check in on an elderly relative and could only visit for a bit each time  - but once we got it working, it does what it intended to do and even more.  The key missing instruction, which can be garnered upon watching the videos alluded to in the instruction booklet, is that in order to view the camera from an offsite location, you must have a static ip address, or obtain one through an outside vendor (or for free through them). You also must understand how to create a specific port for the camera on your network. All of these instructions are clearly reviewed in instructional videos, so be sure to read up and visit the links ahead of time in order to save time and aggravation. While trying to get this camera set up for external viewing, I was frustrated enough to buy an alternate one from a different company which offered instant set up without having to do the ip thing. While that one works as promised, the Foscam camera remains my favorite, as its ability to utilize infra red, and move the lens around the room, were vital to my needs.  The sofware interface is a bit clunky, but for the price, I can't believe I am able to check in on my relative on a regular basis and know what their needs are.

If you use Internet Explorer, you do get the Active X controls for the camera. Which would be fine if they worked well, but it doesn't. There is a big lag in the pan and tilt function and the browser crashes if you go to \\""full screen\\"" mode. Also, the audio does work with IE, but it does not work with Chrome. They tell you to download a plugin to be able to use audio in Chrome and Firefox. I downloaded the plugin and it still doesn't work with Chrome.

In my civilian job, I'm a software developer. I say that because the installation of this product required some skill that the average person may not possess. I have a 2Wire router and use DDNS with port forwarding. This shouldn't be a burden to any device. It's fairly straight forward, however, setting it up was difficult. D-Link has a much faster solution and is far less complicated than this camera.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />Remote viewing, once configured, is solid.<br />Alarm/Motion detection is sufficient.<br />Image is sufficient<br />IR mode exceeded expectation<br />Pan/Tilt is sufficient<br /><br />Con's:<br />Installation is not a turn-key process. You better have a good understanding of your network configuration. If you have to google the following words then you might want to consider spending a little more for a dropcam or a d-link/linksys sort of solution:<br /><br />DDNS, UPnP, Port Forwarding, SMTP, ADSL, DHCP,DNS<br /><br />If those words mean nothing to you, and you purchase this camera, then be prepared to learn some new things. I'm not saying that's a bad thing. In fact, I wish more people understood this stuff (especially my parents) so they'd stop calling me every time their wi-fi flakes out. ;)<br /><br />Best of luck!",26-01-2015

I put my camera in the front door and found the installation, setup, and durability to be amazing. The camera is literally a plug and play kind of camera. I followed the instructions and got my camera to connect to the network within minutes. Then, I fiddled the alert system and the motion detection sensitivity to find the perfect balance for the camera to detect people walking up to the door, but not a random leaf flying through. The great thing about the surveilance is that you can not only broadcast the sound of the environment your camera is in, but also broadcast your voice through the camera. This is quite a useful feature if you want to watch your pet or something that requries your voice. Furthermore, I can set the camera to have certain areas to turn to as a preset and alternate between presets which will make the camera a robotic watchman. This is pretty useful if you have a large area to scan and need constant surveillance.<br /><br />Cons: The one con I have with this camera is that the motion detection, although it works all the time, doesn't have a setting for the camera to record say 30 seconds after detecting motion. Instead, the camera will take about 7 shots and and send them through email to your phone. This is a problem since you are missing certain seconds where people may have done something that you missed. However, it is a problem that isn't that significant. Secondly, the camera cannot change the orientation from portrait to landscape and vice vera. If you want to hang your camera at an angle, you will have to suffer the rath of tilt head syndrome where you can't rotate the video feed so you have to tilt your head to the side in order to watch the video. This is a problem for me since I have my camera basically at an angle so it can see the widest area. The last problem is that the camera will detect motion when the camera switches from night vision to day or vice versa. This is most likely a setting issue, but I found that the motion detection setting that i have that works best has this problem. It isn't that big of a deal since it's just 2 extra emails a day. But, it's still a problem.<br /><br />Verdict: this camera is a great camera for basic surveillance of the house indoor or outdoor. Although if you do do it outdoor, make sure you have a cable that is long enough as well as wifi signal and protection against snow/rain/water. Easy to set up and easy to use. 4/5",26-01-2015

Its best to spend as little as possible to get started playing with IP cameras -- there's a lot to learn and its best to learn with a small initial investment.  Having said that, I have bought three other Foscam units and this camera has the worst image quality.  There's something about the IR filter that doesn't seem right and the colors are just horrible.  Not sure if that's just my unit or a common issue, but don't expect good colors from this camera.  The night quality is pretty good, for indoor use since things are generally pretty close.<br /><br />The pan/tilt performance of this unit is better than the other, higher image quality, Foscam units I have.

The connectivity is nice and easy, just connect via LAN port and set up wifi if you need it.<br /><br />I like that this doesn't have an app that lets you access it from anywhere though I understand why people would want that. I use it as a baby monitor so I only need it while I'm at home. If I wanted to see my kid while away from home I'd just set up port forwarding (be sure to change the username and set a password!). One note if you do that though is to remember that it is not a secure connection so don't try to access your camera from an untrusted network. A VPN would be best.<br /><br />On their Android App, I would like a better battery usage. It would also be nice to keep the sound on when you turn off the screen.",16-01-2015

I don't really need a video cam. I mostly just need to have my DHCP External IP address emailed to me whenever it changes so that I can log into my Smarthome hub. OK, that said, I'm glad I have the camera. It comes in very handy.<br /><br />Setup is not that hard if you know a little about IT and Internet functioning, configuration, and protocol. You need to know your external and internal IP addresses for your modem/router. You need to know how to log into your Internet modem/router, and you need to know how to port forward. You need to know your email server settings. I'm no IT geek genius and I was able to figure most of it out. What I could not figure out I had the tech weenies at Foscam do for me through a shared computer link. Perfectly safe if you're a residential owner. I wouldn't advise doing it if you're a CitiBank VP or Hospital Administrator or if you're a big wig at the NSA.<br /><br />Maybe I can save you some trouble right now and tell you the simple mistakes I made and maybe, just maybe this will save you some time and/or a phone call to Foscam.<br /><br />In Basic Network Settings, manually plug in the camera's current IP address, DNS Server, Subnet Mask, Gateway, and the HTTP port that you're assigning to the camera (Foscam recommends 8080 or 8090). MAKE SURE the 'Obtain IP from DHCP Server' is unchecked.<br /><br />Go into your Internet modem/router and make sure you port forward this port (8080 or 8090) to the camera. Different modems have different dashboards and configurations so it helps to have the make and model number of your modem handy. Just Google 'port forward make-model#' and follow the directions. You will need to know your user name and password to get into the modem/router. This is usually not the same as your network name and password, unless you never changed any of them.<br /><br />Next, use an online \\""open port\\"" checker to make sure this port is open. You'll need your external (public) IP address for this. You can get this three different ways, online from whatismyip.org, by typing 'google my ip' in any browser search window, or by going into DOS or OS and looking at a screenshot of your network config file. If 8080 or 8090 is open, your next step is to try and log in locally with your internal ip. If that goes well, try to log in from somewhere outside your LAN.<br /><br />Set your ddns service before you set your email settings. And change your username and password last.<br /><br />If you want to have Foscam set it up for you, call them and a techie will remote access your computer and set you up in about 3 minutes. Don't expect a lot of chit chat or instruction.<br /><br />Last but not least, I had a real problem logging in remotely and getting the pan and tilt to work. I was sure there was some kind of network or broken link/socket problem. Turns out, I was tapping the control buttons once and waiting for a response. You have to click and hold to get the controls to work.Next, use an online \\""open port\\"" checker to make sure this port is open. You'll need your external (public) IP address for this.

The cameras seem to be as good as new, and so far work fine), they are deserving of 5 stars. If you want a cheap camera that does the job, this is probably the one.    They are relatively easy to set up. The first one took me about 30 minutes to figure out. The second two I was able to set up in less than 5 minutes. Picture quality is good thought not HD, and the night vision feature is pretty impressive. I can see my baby clearly even when the room is pitch black!    My main complaint is that the available software kind of sucks. The official Foscam software is useless, and barely worked. uFoscam is a 3rd party app, and the best I was able to find for iPhone, was easy to set up, but the interface is very crude, and not the easiest to navigate. Though that being said, it serves my purposes of having three cameras in my home to monitor my baby and nanny when we are out. I can view all 3 cameras on one screen, and can move the cameras, and turn night vision on and off remotely. Also like being able to talk into the camera through the app....though mostly used to freak out my wife when I'm not home. I haven't managed to get any desktop software to work yet for monitoring all 3 cameras on one screen but I haven't tried too hard. Haven't managed to set up recording yet, though I think there is a way. Also motion detection in the app is not very well implemented.    If you have a bigger budget I'm sure it would be worth getting more expensive cameras, but if your budget is limited, these do the job just fine. With any luck, better software will be available for these cameras in future.    Overall, good not great, but for the price deserving of 5 stars.",09-01-2015

This was the infuriating part which almost made me return it. I wish I had the guide that I found online that helped me fix this but make sure you pay VERY close attention to that  serial number on the bottom of the camera-not just the model number.<br /><br />On to the camera, the picture is grainy and passable quality which is fine for what I and I figure many would use this device for. You can tell what people are doing and has enough detail to make out what is going on. One thing that bothers me is the refresh rate says it's 60hz but it's clearly running 30 or less FPS. While I don't need 60fps, seeing that refresh rate and the actual rate the wireless is delivering feels a bit like a lie to me.<br /><br />All and all the camera works well, you can easily pan it to look around and use the mic to hear if there's anything going on/anyone hurt.  I just recommend you take care in updating the device's firmware  and only tackle this thing if you're tech savvy unless you have it wired up.",08-01-2015

The major negative is the audio not working at all.  **Beware** of hackers.  In the first month, we didn't set the password, and we noticed a few times the camera had shifted on its own, meaning someone had hacked in.  All in all, it is a decent camera.

I just found some videos on YouTube that walked me through step by step how to set it up. I set up port forwarding so that i can access the camera from anywhere. I debated about getting the newer version of this camera, but i don't need full HD, and its hard to beat this price. I just wanted to be able to see if someone was in my house and check in on the dog. For those purposes the video quality is more than sufficient. I can easily distinguish peoples features from way across the room. I downloaded the IPhone app, and now i can check the camera anywhere from my phone. This comes in handy to make sure the dog has not eaten our house. I have yet to use the two way audio so i am not sure how well the speaker works.",29-12-2014

I waited more an hour to speak with Foscam tech support and they instructed me to download software which would not work.  I would warm anyone to avoid this product as getting it set up is very difficult, and tech support is incompetent and can barely communicate.  Also be careful who you buy products like this from.  I bought this on Groupon and their return policies are so restrictive that I'm stuck with two cameras now that are non-fuctioning because I simply don't have the time for hours and hours of poor tech support.  Message to Groupon- I will be shopping for goods now through Amazon where they have enlightened and consumer friendly return policies.",28-12-2014

However the problem comes from the user manual and installation guide which are VERY POORLY WRITTEN (I truly believe the authors of these manuals didn't get sufficient trainings, the company is a small LLC company).  I spent so much more time than I thought it could be. ActiveX control code for IE11 of Windows 7 does not work, eventually found that I have to disable the security under IE setting to BYPASS SECURITY check from Windows 7 (the certificate expired a few months ago but they didn't recertify the software).  It works now but I feel tired.  Words to FOSCAM folks: please keep improving this big weakness and attract more customers and make them happy.    I emailed the problem to them on Friday, they got back to me on Sunday night and Monday with new plugins in a link which they claim can solve the problem. I will try as soon as I can. I hope they will update this in their official website to avoid issue to others.  ------------------------------------from FOSCAM support----------------------  We have released new plug-ins to resolve the issue of not getting the certificate installed on Internet Explorer, you can download them here:  IPCWebComponents-new.zip  All HD cameras for version 2.x.1.10 and later    IPCComponents-2342wjx.zip  All HD cameras for version before 2.x.1.10    DVM_IPCam.zip  For all MJPEG series  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------",14-12-2014

First, these cameras, in my opinion, are excellent for the price!  The color is very good and you can adjust the motion to move the cameras vertical and horizontal faster or slower.  The directions are straight forward and I didn't have any trouble putting things on my network.  The Wi-Fi setup does take a little understanding about your router.  If you understand how to set port forwarding on your router, the setup will be a snap.  I have an Apple Airport Extreme, the newest N version and setting up a port forwarding is very simple.  These cameras come with port 80 as their default but I highly recommend putting the port to a higher number, I put mine on the 2,000's for each one.  First you will hook the camera up to your router via the RJ45 cable, included, follow the instructions to change the port forwarding number on the camera, you'll be able to see what the camera is looking at right away with the included software, very straight forward.  Be sure to know your routers password to make adjustment for Wi-Fi setup and you'll be good to go.  Now, having said all that, I will tell you it took me less than 15 minutes to set each of these cameras up on my Wi-Fi setup and also via the APP for viewing locally and anywhere in the world again, with the port forwarding setup.  I do understand where some have had problems setting these cameras up, knowing your own wireless system, setup and password, makes things a lot easier but there can still be glitches.  Your router will restart when you put in a new port forwarding and you can also setup a static IP address  for each of the cameras you have, again, it is listed in the easy instructions.  The nicer APP for iPhone and iPad was $5.99 on the Apple APP store, there was a free one but had limited setup so decided to get the better one and glad I did.  Now we have local and distant viewing of our upstairs and downstairs, with just two cameras.  The motion is very smooth and unless you are standing right next to the camera while it is moving, you can't really hear them at all.  I can't attest to the quality of the audio since I haven't used that yet, I can tell you that the video and color are excellent for a non HD camera, I am very pleased with these cameras!  The night vision worked great, total darkness last night and I could see great in each of the rooms where the cameras were located.  I know there are better cameras out there, most cost twice or more what these cost, in one case I looked at an HD IP Camera, the price was over three times what each of these Foscams cost, those were HD cameras and I can image the high quality of the images they produce, but I wasn't interested in that, I wanted a couple of good quality, good color cameras with full range of motion to work with my Wi-Fi and be able to check the house locally or from anywhere in the world, and that is what I got.  So far so good, happy with the quality of these IP Cameras for the price!",07-12-2014

The picture and sound is soooo much more clear and more easily adjusted than the standard baby monitor that we had. The clearer picture alone made a huge difference.

Nice remote access features.,"I initially bought one of these cameras for use at the office, as there had been some reports of break-ins in the area. Some of the main features that I was looking for included pan-tilt, auto-focus, motion detection, wireless access, smart phone control and viewing capability, and email alerts. This camera had all of those features that I was looking for.<br /><br />I've now had it for about two months and I am pretty happy with it so far. I downloaded the IP Cam Viewer app for my phone and iPad, which works very well. I also use an old iPhone basically as a solid state DVR, which is running all the time. It has the option of being set up for certain hours or for continuous use. It can also record only upon motion detection. I set it up to record continuously from 6pm to 7am. With how much memory my old phone has available it is able to keep 3-4 days of storage at any given time.<br /><br />My only complaint is with the email alert system. I haven't been able to fine-tune the motion detection sensitivity to send emails when there is actual motion activity inside or outside of the office. If I can somehow figure out how to fix this problem I would give it 5 stars without any reservations.",01-12-2014

I had been trying for months with the first camera to get the DNS (free w purchase) to work.  I tried many troubleshooting steps in addition to tapping the expertise of my brother who is a network expert.  I reluctantly tried Foscam tech support.  The first thing she requested was remote access which I declined; she then was stuck on port forwarding even though I confirmed that it was setup and working properly.  She was obviously reading from script and would not budge.  I kept bringing her back to what I thought was the issue but she would not budge off of port forwarding issues.  I disconnected from her and tried again to contact support.  (In my years of experience in tech support, rep surfing is sometimes the only way to get proper help; I expect 1 good tech support rep for every 3 calls made).  I was lucky with the next support person I reached.  Instead of phrasing my issue that I could not get my DNS to work, I instead asked if the Manufacturer's Domain in the DDNS Service Settings should be blank.  This worked.  The rep asked me to very firmware version and when she confirmed it was the latest version, she told me that the camera firmware was faulty and required replacement.  The only issue is that they required me to send it in and be without it for an unknown period of time.  This camera was purchased to check in on an elderly family member who recently had surgery.  Even without the DNS working, I am able to view using iCam app on my iPhone which uses the internal IP address.  I then requested advanced replacement from Foscam (since my return period with Amazon had expired) and provided my credit card info for authorization.  I emailed not once, not twice but three times and have received no reply.  I decided to purchase a second camera for myself and set it up the same day I received it and it worked without issue so I know that the blank DDNS info is the cause of the issue.  Not only are the cameras hit or miss, but so is the support.  I have worked in tech support for over 15 years....be wary of reviewers indicating that support is great....no company has spot on tech support 100% of the time.the cameras hit or miss, but so is the support.

It's not easy to make out faces for example, which seems essential to me. If you know who the person is already, you could tell it's their face. If a stranger were to appear on the video then it'd be hard to exactly identify them from what you have.  - The motion detection is primitive. It seems either too sensitive or not sensitive enough. Something like switching lights on/off will set off motion detection, despite an option available which claims to reduce false positives from light changes. Expect at least a week of tweaking the sensitivity options. Even the IR lights turning on/off will trigger the motion detection.

I am definitely computer savvy, but not an network expert. This is my first surveillance camera experience, After some struggles, I finally got it running on WiFi. The wired ethernet, was no problem.  The WiFi setup was helped a lot by the simplified WPS. Make sure you have a WPS enabled WiFi router.  I have also been able to setup the ftp upload service. I have my own .com domain ($1.89 per month), so that helped.  But the email alert system still do not work out for me, and after reading some Foscam blogs, it seems like there is a lot of issues there. Most users have problems, obviously depending on the ISP and/or your gmail etc set up.  Setup manual seems to be pretty complete, but when working with details, there is a lot of things that are not explained enough, or you have to be an experienced installer.  So for now, the Foscam is not my favorite in WiFi mode, since system fails to make the email alerts.  That might be a different issue if Foscam is connected to a DVR/NVR  I will try to keep updating my experience with this Foscam    A couple hours later...    OK  I have made the camera to forward email alerts now, and it works great.  But I could not use the gmail smpt, so I used my own domains email, hosted by one.com in Denmark ($1.89 per month is a steal btw). I contacted the 24/7 chat line, and the technician told me to use port 2525, and not to use any Transport Layer Security...  And Voila, it works great...

I read some reviews saying how difficult it was to set up.  Then I saw some youtube videos that made it look not so bad.  I should have heeded the reviews!  This thing does NOT install itself.  I can't get the IP Camera Tool to find the camera IP address when the thing is hooked up to my router.  The instructions are useless, written in broken English in large part.  The tool just shows a blank page, no IP addresses.  The manual says if the IP addresses don't show up automatically, then make sure the DHCP is enabled and MAC address filtering, firewalls and anti-virus are turned off.  What the heck is a DHCP?  How would I know if Mac address filtering is on or off? None of that is explained or discussed. Turning off the firewalls and anti-virus is as far as I know.  Anything else requires an advanced degree in computer tech.  Unless you know what that junk means, steer clear of this turkey.    Step one is to plug it in to the outlet and your router.  Check.  I couldn't make it through step 2, use the IP camera tool.    I bought this camera at a charity silent auction, it had never been used.  Now I know why.  Too bad I wasted my money.  I can't even return this thing.  Dropping it off a tall building is looking like my most attractive option.    Three hours of my life have been pissed away, trying to get this thing to work.  I'll never get that time back, and there are so many productive things I could have done instead.  Supremely frustrated.    Oh yea, only giving it one star because Amazon won't let me give it none.    Additional comments.  After writing above, I texted a friend who has a couple of these.  She told me she had to have her brother who works in IT set it up for her. It was not easy or fast for someone who works in IT. She also suggested looking on the internet for an IP cam viewer.  I found one on CNet and tried it. No go.  I then went looking for others.  After about the 3rd download (I actually think they were all the same program, just different sites offering it), and with the non working IP camera tool still up, I somehow managed to cross proton streams and got an image through the camera.  I was able to pan and see my cats milling around, wondering what I was doing up at 1am. At that point, I copied all the information the camera tool had, that is the missing IP address and all the other techno babble. I then tried to untether the camera from the router and the whole thing crashed.    I spent another 2.5 hours trying to recreate the accident that got the thing to work, and this time I even tried using the camera IP address I had just found.  No go.  I finally gave up at 3:30 in the morning.    The only thing I have to show for all this effort is 3 hours of sleep and I'll be cranky all day at work.    I can't say it enough, while the camera might be OK, the software and rigamarole to set it up sucks big time.  Avoid this thing at all costs.  I'm going to look for a plug and play IP camera from some other manufacturer.",30-10-2014

It has a very decent picture (considering it's not HD) and I love being able to pan and tilt it remotely.  I'm using it to keep track of a rescue cat who recently adopted me.  He showed up on my property starving - literally.  That was 3 months ago and now I've got him back up to full normal body weight and he is doing great.  He's just getting used to a cat door I put in and since I'm away from home a lot I wanted the ability to see him coming and going.  This camera works great for that.<br /><br />HOWEVER, set up is not for the faint of heart.  I worked in IT for nearly two decades and it was a real challenge for me.  Admittedly, network infrastructure wasn't my area of expertise, which is where the issues were in setting this camera up.<br /><br />Getting it to work on my local network (LAN) was not so easy because (after lots of head scratching and about 45 minutes of trying and trying again) I read something somewhere about making sure the security protocol that the WIFI router was set to matched what was expected by the Foscam software.  In the Foscam software there is a drop-down box to select which security your router is using, and none of the selections matched what mine was set to so I had to reset my router to a security protocol that Foscam understood (WPA2-Personal with TKIP and AES).<br /><br />That resolved that issue and I was able to view the camera from home, but I couldn't access it when I was away from home.  After a lot of fooling around with my router making port forwarding rules (failed) and then virtual server rules (also failed), I finally discovered the problem was with my Internet Service Provider, which had a router behind my router that blocked all internet traffic that originated on the WAN (in other words, nothing could get to my router that wasn't a reply to a request that originally came from my router).<br /><br />I called my ISP and asked them to stop blocking my access.  They said they would, for an additional $10/month.  Wow.  An additional $120 per year just to look at a cat once in a while?  I don't think so.  So I was basically screwed.  I ended up doing a workaround involving a remote access program called Teamviewer (free for personal use).  The downside is that I have to remote into a laptop I leave running at home and then access the camera feed via that computer.  This works because my laptop advertises its presence via Teamviewer so when I connect to it I am essentially replying to that, so it gets through my ISP's firewall.  I'm still researching ways to bypass that so I don't have to leave a computer running at home, but haven't found a solution yet.  This works great in the meantime though.<br /><br />Another issue is that I haven't been able to get the audio to work yet.  Both IE and Firefox say I need to install a plugin from VLC, which I did, but it gives me an error.  I haven't spent any time trying to resolve that yet because I really don't need the audio, but thought I'd mention it for those who do.<br /><br />P.S.  I discovered Teamviewer when I contacted Foscam support to help me set this camera up, and that's what they used to remote into my computer to make changes.  They weren't able to resolve the issue with my ISP's firewall, but seeing how Teamviewer worked gave me the idea to use it myself just to get this thing online..

This model does have its own DNS built in (from Foscam) in order to work with dynamic IP's without having the need to sign up for dyndns or no-up services. You will want a static IP set up in the programming of the camera though.<br /><br />Multiple log-ins can be set up including administrator (full rights), controller (controls but no setting changes), and guest (view image only).<br /><br />Image seems decent in both IR and full color.<br /><br />The activeX (internet explorer) web control interface is better than the push mode (firefox, chrome, etc). In activeX you can display multiple cameras in a grid as well as record to .avi video file directly from the web control. Push mode is lacking both of those functions. (see images for both examples). I wish the web control had designated buttons for the presets rather than a drop down and go button, this makes switching between presets slow and cumbersome.<br /><br />Lost one star on review for having to use IE for full web control functionality as I do not use IE for anything else.

I'm considering hiring a professional to come in and finish setting the cameras up for me but honestly I'm hesitant to spend the money. They make it look so easy on the youtube videos.

More problems than you can shake a stick at!  Glad they don't do NAS!,"Wow, I Purchased the Foscam f18910w , and anyone that has read any of my past reviews on technology knows I have a deep technical background and often can go in to intimate detail about issues I run in to.  In this case it simply is not worth my time.<br />If you scan their forums for the f18910w you will see many people, some with other foscam models in addition to the f18910w are having problems with disconnect upon connecting to the forward port, or even disconnect on the local LAN!<br /><br />My problem is even simpler. Sending a email alert.  Now I know it is not a gmail, or yahoo mail problem because I am sending the mail out my own working SMTP gateway running on a server I have in &#34;formerly The Planet D4&#34; data center in Dallas, now IBM owned, and I sent all my email through the SMTP server.  I have enabled SSL on port 469, TLS on port 587, and no security at all on port 25.  I can send emails through all the ports, and the IP of my server is within my own domain, which is one I own through godaddy.com...<br /><br />Setting up the email is simple.  When TLS didn't work, I used simple No encryption, and just log in port 25 with user and password.<br />The TEST does not even succeed.  Not an entry in the log.  So of course I spanned my Cisco 3064 switch port the camera was on, and looked at the trace.  The Foscam f18910w  is sending out a handshake, the SMTP server replies, and that is the end of the trace.  The Foscam than resets itself completely and I have to log in again at the fixed IP I gave it.<br /><br />I suppose for $70 I at least expect it to be able to handle sending an email alert! That is the point of using motion sensor ability to send an alarm if it can't even send to a SMTP email server?  All I can say is &#34;Check the companies &#34;Support forums&#34; before you buy!  I am sending this POS back.  Suppose I will have to use something like a NETBOTZ like I have been doing in data center designs for years.  They are more costly, but they have been around for two decades and they just work.  Tested by hundreds of data centers for two decades.<br /><br />There is NO WAY I would trust this to monitor my infant.  Firmware issues, protocol problems, this company seems to be a mess.  That is really too bad.",19-10-2014

It was a bit of a pain to get set up. It took a few hours until we were able to see video from outside our network, but we did get it to work, and it works beautifully. The speaker is clear and works well, but the mic is pretty terrible. We have a small mic that we use with a small video camera that we plugged into the jack, and it works great. We travel a good bit, and we use this to check on the first floor of the house and to do a head count of the cats while we are gone.

ERIC HILL IS AMAZING! I bought these cameras thinking, &#34;Ok, I'm an intelligent person. I can't install these myself.&#34; WRONG! I was so lost right from the start :( I made the dreaded decision to call customer service-right? Admit it-no one wants to have to call. Well, I was pleasantly surprised! Eric Hill helped me out, didn't judge my lack of techno intelligence and got everything worked out with no problems! I am highly impressed!<br /><br />As far as the actual cameras go-So far so good. I am using these in my children's bedrooms and I mounted each in the corners of their rooms. I can clearly see their beds. The night vision is beginning to come on and I can still see quiet well. As far as the quality of the picture goes-I can clearly see what my children are doing (i.e. are they in bed or playing?) however, (from the corner of the room) they are not clear enough to be able to see if my children are breathing. That's one of the only negative thoughts I've had thus far, &#34;Man, I wish I could zoom.&#34; My other, yet unanswered, question is, &#34;Am I going to know if this freezes and I'm looking at an old frame?&#34; I'm not sure. I'm hoping the camera has some sort of mechanism that will turn off the viewing from my side if the camera stream is frozen. I suppose I'll find out. As far as the distance from the router goes- our router is downstairs and I have both cameras upstairs. We have 10 or 11 foot ceilings. One of the cameras seems to be picking up quite well. The other I'm not so sure about yet. This might be more of an issue with our cheap router rather than a reflection of the camera quality. Also, I downloaded the app for my iphone and though it has terrible reviews I think it will do the job. It will be nice to be able to log in when I'm at work and want to check in on naptime.<br /><br />So, day 1 and I'm giving these cameras a 5star rating when considering the price. Are they the most amazing cameras I've ever imagined? No. And would I expect that for barely more than fifty bucks a piece? No way.<br /><br />For the price",12-10-2014

On the positive side, their GUI good looking and is easy to understand and use.  Other webcams costing half the price sometimes show Chinese characters by default (but there is usually an \\""English\\"" button to change the GUI language). The Foscam GUI is clean and in clear English.    On the down side, their firmware is notoriously confusing.  You must disclose personal information to get updated firmware, and it's really easy to flash the wrong image, resulting in a brick.  I would not pass an undergrad computer science student's project with their firmware design and implementation -- it's that bad.  Also, customer service is a black hole.  Questions go in, nothing comes out.    I have two Foscams, and each of them flicker/flash IR all night.  With no discernable light source in the room, the IR lamps flash bright, then dim, in a never-ending cycle all night.  I've also noted a click (perhaps that's the IR board???).  Very bothersome.    I'm sticking with ELP and KaiCong cameras for now. ELP are hard to configure, but have great picture quality.  Read Amazon reviews of KaiCong  -- price does not necessary reflect picture quality.  The Amazon reviews will help you find the gems.    UPDATE (NOV 2014) -- After posting this review I was contacted by Foscam to replace the webcam, something I appreciated.  Before I could send the webcam back, my 2nd FI8910W webcam started acting up.  I wasn't sure what to do, so I thought about it for a while.  My decision -- put both FI8910W webcams on the shelf.  Getting replacements of the same model could prolong my aggravation if I have problems down the road.  I do not want anything to do with FI8910W's anymore. (On the fun side, I'm thinking about replacing the optics with a ELP-IP1881, keeping the webcam's rotate and pan/tilt motors; the end result may look like a frank-n-cam, but it'll have good optics and a good motor base for remote adjust.  Justan idea, but it might work).",08-10-2014

Maybe in the future I will also buy the HD version. Ok so now about this camera; for me it was relatively easy to set it up. You can set it down and, with some technical tweaking on the router, have it operational in minutes (some router and DNS understanding is helpful, but the installation book gives details). Have it email you when it detects motion, or have 2-way conversations from your iPad, iPhone, or PC. Excellent iPad app allows full control. Pan, tilt, but no zoom. Remote zoom and focus would make this perfect, but would also probably double the price. Night vision works great. Keep an eye on your place when you're out of town. Check in on Mom and Dad to make sure things are okay, get emails if there's motion when you don't expect there to be. I use an android app called IP Camera, which works well. You can't use the APP they mention in the paperwork unless you go all the way and get a control HUB. Browser controls vary with the browser. IE will give you the most versatility, but FireFox and Chrome also work, with varying degrees of success. The iPad app is the best. Intuitive controls and speakerphone.

It worked well, I never experienced any of the freezing or random rebooting that was mentioned in another review.  However, after 2.5 years of being plugged in, it finally died. I noticed I was unable to connect to it last week and decided to reboot it.  It worked fine for a couple of days but it happened again. I've since tried to reboot it and it no longer goes through it's boot-up routine of panning the camera around. I figured maybe it was just the camera part having an issue but it doesn't even show up on my router's client list anymore. Just two or 3 of the IR LEDs are a faint red. I plan on taking it apart, maybe a fuse blew. I will update if I figure out what went wrong.    edit: The circuit board definitely has a burnt electronics smell to it but I cannot see any damage. To be fair, it was never plugged into a surge protector.  I am going to purchase the FI9821W V2 as a replacement and make sure it is behind a surge protector.    UPDATE: I received the FI9821W and hooked up the power supply to the FI8910W I thought was dead and it powered right up. Apparently these adapters have a relatively short lifespan. I have ordered a replacement power supply and will keep using it as a secondary camera.",03-10-2014

Unfortunately I bought it to be able to monitor the cats when I was out of town, and I 'm having terrible time trying to access it from outside.  I've gone through the routines for setting the ports etc in my router, and changing the settings on the firewall, and all the other things that Foscam, ATT and various help sites have said to do and I still can't get it to work.  This has been going on for months (I only have just so much time to devote to it).  In addition, one of the units fell off the table and the antenna broke off.  After an extremely confusing and garbled live chat session with a rep, I learned that I can have a new antenna sent for free, but can't work out where to send the request.    When I'm on the home network, I am very pleased, and am very hopeful that someday I'll be able to get it to work externally, but for the moment I remain unsuccessful.    Update 15 Oct 2014    This is an update to my review above.  Foscam customer service were very prompt about responding to the above review (which I honestly hadn't expected).  When I finally had time to respond, I promptly received a call from Salah, in their support area, who was extremely helpful.  He took control of my screen and stuck with the problems until we finally had them resolved.  I am able to see the feeds from both cameras while not on my home network.  He was very patient, as fix after fix didn't work, but he persisted and we finally got there.  I was very glad for his help because the setup proved to be just as squirrely as I had suspected.  And then he took the time to search out an app that worked on my phone so I could use that as well.  I was very impressed.  And grateful!  The rating is 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the hitches.  I am pleased with the cameras (can spy on the cats now) and very pleased with the service.",12-09-2014

So that is what this short review is addressing. I am A quite technical person in program computers. But I did find the camera difficult to set up. Probably because I don't have a lot of time now I have a newborn! And I don't have a lot of patience for things like port forwarding dynamic versus static IP address excetera excetera. I am sure if I or you took the time the camera can be set up quite adequately.  But I do not want to take the time. There are several other cameras on eBay and Amazon which are just as inexpensive as this one or even more so that do all the setup automatically with a wizard. So why bother? Unless you enjoy this sort of thing I would go with another camera. I bought this camera because the reviewed audio quality of the camera was superior to many others that were reviewed. This may be true,  I do not know. Regardless it does have an audio in jack which will accept a microphone, perhaps a noise cancelling microphone which might make this camera much better than other ones. I bought it for use as a baby monitor , and the previous camera I bought had a lot of background noise and hiss which made it unuseable at night. so if u have the technical know-how , tome and patience and want (possible) better audio quality, go for this one. else go for one that has an automatic setup wizard.",11-09-2014

Other than the quality being worse than I expected, most likely because of the complexity of the scene I was trying to capture, the device would spontaneously reboot and crash at least once per day, making it useless as a permanent security cam. In addition, all of the options for publishing motion detect images were unreliable, and were so slow to respond to movement that I would often miss the actual event. For example, as the mailman walks up to the door, the device has about 20 feet of the mailman walking to get its act together and snap a picture. Instead, the very first image is of the mailman's face just past the edge of the screen. Another reviewer has commented that there might be a crash/reboot defect caused by complex scenes, and I suspect I was running into this defect.",24-08-2014

I waited too long to have it repaired within the warranty period (because I thought I had done something wrong).  Nevertheless, when I contacted Foscam for help, the only &#34;help&#34; they offered was to tell me that I have to buy a new one.  I was beyond the warranty.  My fault.  I know. But here's the funny part.  I didn't ask for a new camera free of charge.  I asked for help (And I have the email to prove it). I am an engineer and could have fixed it if they gave me the instructions.  However, they didn't offer any help of any sort.  Any reputable company would have at least attempted something. And after reading through the reviews, it seems quite evident that many people have received faulty cameras...and even then...the repair process is quite a hassle.  Thumbs down, Foscam.",24-08-2014

After hearing a few crashes from the pets, I decided on this two-way audio cam to check on dad. The booklet with instructions is for Windows OS or MAC OS.  Since I mainly use Android compatible tablet &amp; phones, I had to dust off my old PC laptop with Windows XP.  The camera comes with a software CD, installation guide, network cable, screw on antenna, plastic mounting bracket with screws, and 5 foot long power cord.  My home has fast internet wi-fi so setup was not bad.  I really relied on the booklet, but needed extra help from Foscam's technical support.  Foscam Rep named Jack assisted me by assigning a new static IP address for the camera. After setting it up on my old PC, I accessed the live camera feed a couple of times and then changed the password from default. Then I installed several free Android apps on my cell phone and tablet to view, pan/tilt and even monitor sound. One free app is Foscam US.<br /><br />*** The most important thing I learned is to use the &quot;ec###.myfoscam.org&quot; address (instead of the actual IP address 168.###.1.###) to access the camera feed.  It is listed underneath the cam, so I enter this on my Android viewer apps so I can access live video while AWAY FROM HOME. Otherwise, if I use the cam's IP address, I can access feed near my home wifi only. Thanks to Foscam technical support Felix Anderson for this tip!***<br /><br />I also got IP Cam viewer's upgrade for to enable wireless remote talk for my tablet and cell. I prefer the quick access using my Android portable devices rather than my heavy dinosaur PC.  My Foscam camera is small, dome shaped with a good base so my cats can not knock it over. The quality of the live view is great and now monitor my dad in my living room. I did buy a second cam for the covered back porch. So I can see my living room &amp; pets even during the night. I can also share the cam info and password with a sibling to check on dad. This Foscam cam for about $65 is so worth it because it gives me peace of mind.  UPDATE:  Still very, very happy with cams.  Talk to dad when away from home using IP Cam Viewer Pro by Robert Chou app on Android devices.  Always remember to change the default password that comes with the camera to avoid unwanted peeping jerks.bout $65 is so worth it because it gives me peace of mind.

I used the CD and did the set-up using Internet Explorer (!!!), which worked quite well for this application. Once you scan for your network, all the fields should fill in automatically. Then using the supplied IPCamera program, you have to right click on the camera IP to disable the DHCP in order to set the static IP address so that you don't have to keep editing it (you can also do this in the Device Manager but you have to know subnet mask etc). Haven't tried accessing it externally yet.<br /><br />I also use IPCAM VIEWER from Chou, because I am accustomed to it. It has the 8910W already there too, and gives good PT control, presets as well as switching the IR on/off. The IR lights aren't that bright which is good for baby monitoring. The video in dark areas using IR is excellent.<br /><br />The camera itself doesn't have optical zoom, but you can screen zoom on your apps since the picture quality is quite good. Foscam gives you a plastic mounting stand, so check that out before you buy an external one. Also I went ahead and bought two power extension cables - glad I did because the original one is short. For $65 USD I think it's pretty good, will definitely work for my purpose.",19-08-2014

The speakers have gone out on both it just sounds like static when you talk and the mic has also gone out so I cant hear anything anymore.

Easy set up for local network viewing over wifi or ethernet.<br /><br />ii. Excellent camera with excellent technology; very quiet and superb controls over the telemetry (remote control).<br /><br />Cons:<br />i. Almost impossible to set up local recording. Does not come with local recording software, and the unique protocol Foscam uses are different from industry standards. Thus, when attempting to use a 3rd party recording application, e.g. Xeoma, it just does not work properly.<br /><br />ii. Foscam does offer their own remote viewing and recording, cloud-based service (https://www.foscamcloud.com). Spent 4 hours trying to configure this service for the camera. It never worked.<br /><br />iii. The representative advised me that the recording software that it comes with, 'Blue Iris' is not compatible with Mac computers. They have too many bugs in the software! I wish it had stated this on the product description.<br /><br />iv. Foscam technical suport was a complete waste of time. Based in India, so the line was terrible and the representative knew less about the technology than I did. He then proceeded to request remote access to my computer. When I declined but asked if he would talk me through his checks and solutions, he agreed, but it validated my suspicion about his lack of knowledge. He proceeded to tell me that Foscam has a problem with the cloud service due to over-subscription, but then said that the browser-based service in question does not work well with Macs. When I questioned whether he meant the safari browser vs. another, and offered to change browser, he changed his analysis again, and asked me to hold while he checked with his supervisor for other ideas.<br /><br />In summary, I was delighted with the price and the technology, but was left very disappointed that Foscam has not thought about how one should be able to record with its cameras. Not only has Foscam gone against common industry protocols making its cameras useless for 3rd party recording software, but its own service does not work.<br /><br />I am sending this back.

The resolution needs to be bumped up (only 640x480), the controllability needs to be improved via the available software, and if they're going to advertise free DDNS service to view the camera they're selling they certainly should provide a better guide for the implementation of that service.  That said, once it's all hooked up the camera does a good job, you can see fairly well and point it where you like.  The wireless signal is pretty good and there was no difficulty getting it hooked up to the router, either via WiFi protected setup or via Ethernet cable.  The differing web views for the camera are handy, but unfortunately only one provides access to the camera config settings.  The smartphone view does NOT have access to camera settings. you have to use a different page that is very inconvenient to view (too large for phone, have to drag/zoom the screen around to see).  To sum up, the camera is about 3.5-4 stars, but the software and setup is only 3 stars.",04-08-2014

Yes, it includes software and instructions for setup, but they're pretty much worthless if you're on a Mac. Now I'm no IT guru, but I can work my way around my home wifi network well enough... This installation however put me through an intensive 4 hour course on networking that was death to suffer through but probably qualifies me for any Tech job I want now. seriously this was a beastly process that kept me up until 2:00 am 'cause dang it I had to show the Mrs. what kind of man she married! The cd that comes with it installs a useless tool on Macs that attempts to give you the rest of the info you'll need to proceed with setup, needless to say, other reviews decently cover the process of how to get this baby filming, but I can post my nightmare process if desired.<br /><br />Let me tell you though, the setup is worth it! This bad boy saves me from so many trips into the kiddo's room at night it's not even funny.<br /><br />Usefulness: did I mention how much this has changed my life? Sleep?  Yeah I get that now.  We busted this out at a time when our then 4-month old started moving around the crib too much for comfort for her overprotective parents.

Learning to adjust the camera has a little bit of a learning curve, but fortunately you can use pre-sets to once you have it set up the way you like. Using it in his room the lighting was the most challenging part. He has a night light they was causing an issue with us being able to see into his crib, but eventually we got it perfect.

You do get what you pay for. The camera itself functions great however there are some things that annoy me which is the reason for the missing stars.<br /><br />Positives:<br />- Brand, they are a big brand so customer support &#34;should&#34; be there as well as firmware and software updates.<br />- It pans, zooms, without having to manually adjust the camera. For the price, this is a good feature.<br />- Ease of use and connectivity. I was able to get this up and running quickly. Added it to my xeoma server.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />- If your down with continuous clicking this is for you. The clicking is loud and annoying. If the light adjusts from the curtains and my AC unit, it clicks on and off all day. IR relay is so loud.<br />- The picture quality could use some work for the price I had paid for this camera. I didn't have the expectation of having HD quality in a lower resolution camera however the quality of the video / photos seem to be well, mediocre. It's 2014, my macbook pro has better picture quality and it's designed to be a laptop not a camera... Seems the camera is a bit behind in technology.<br /><br />The moving functionality of this camera via panning and tilting are the highlights of this camera, unfortunately the picture quality is mediocre. Your iphone camera will have much better quality... Being the device is designed specifically a camera, it's way behind on the most important part of the camera, picture quality.",22-07-2014

This camera has night vision, which is great if you want to monitor with no light, and it actually does excellent! I put the camera inside a window looking out, and when the infrared comes on at night it reflects on the window and blinds the camera. Since I have plenty of light at night I've been turning off the infrared manually every night, because I haven't found a way to turn it off permanently. I'm not too concerned about it because I will eventually move it outside (not exposed to the elements, but not behind glass). The quality of the video is better that I was expecting from a camera that's wireless, with night vision, pan and tilt, e-mail notifications, motion detection at such low price. I was hesitant to buy it, but I'm glad a took a chance.<br /><br />I have to admit that the setup is a bit challenging for someone who is not familiar with how routers work and how to achieve port forwarding, and networking in general. I didn't have to call for tech support, but the videos on the foscam.us website really helped me grasp the concept of the setup. I started watching the videos before I even received the camera, so when I got it in the mail I had a basic understanding of what I needed to do.<br /><br />I just wanted to add one more thing: my internet provider issued me a modem/wireless router combo, but since I have a nice router that I wanted to use, they disabled the wireless router part of their modem, so I had issues with port forwarding: I opened the ports in my router, but canyouseeme.org kept saying it was still blocked. I called my provider to ask them if they blocked that port on their side, and he proceeded to tell me that they didn't but the modem/router combination did, so I would have to either open the port on both THEIR router and MY route, or go to their local office and swap it for a regular modem. I opted of the stand alone modem and once I did the ports were opened and everything worked great.<br /><br />If you're thinking about getting this camera, please take the time to watch the setup videos on the foscam website and do not rush through the setup, otherwise you will get frustrated with it!",17-07-2014

I liked the FI8910W so much I bought three more over the next few months. If my security alarm goes off I get an alert on my cell phone and can now see what is happening inside my home in real time. The built-in camera software allows you to access and control the camera over the Internet from anywhere.<br /><br />Setting up my first camera was a challenge because I had never done it before, but the next three only took about ten minutes each. I used the included IPcamera software to assign specific IP addresses and port numbers for each camera, and to upgrade the firmware before doing anything else. Foscam has some helpful setup videos in the support section of their website so I didn't have to call customer support for assistance.<br /><br />Here are a couple of tips I discovered. If you don't want the camera to point at the ceiling on reboot then go to Device Management, PT Settings, and uncheck the \\""Go to center on boot\\"" check box. If you don't want the little green LED on the back of the camera to flash all the time, go to Device Management, Basic Network Settings, and uncheck the \\""Network Lamp\\"" check box.<br /><br />A couple of things I don't like about this camera are that the IR LEDs are visible in the dark, and the annoying click when the IR-cut off switches from daytime to night vision (and sometimes back again). Overall I am very satisfied with these cameras. The speaker and microphone are weak, and the video is not crystal clear, but for the money they can't be beat.",14-07-2014

They are a good value and have good features for their price range.  I run two of them as baby video monitors, one as an indoor security camera, and I run two of them outside (way outside their environmental operating spec ranges - sometimes down to -5°F, sometimes up to +100°F, sometimes in the snow, sometimes covered in bird poop) in motion detection mode to capture images of people coming to my front or back door.<br /><br />They are internet connected, can upload images to an FTP site, attach them to emails, have scheduled motion detection alarm times, can be panned and tilted, have 2-way audio (not very good quality, but neat nevertheless), and support wifi and wired ethernet.  And there's a multitude of apps out there for iPhone and Android to control this camera.<br /><br />One negative is that they are supposed to support UPnP, but I've never gotten that to work on my all-Apple network.  I don't know if it's the AirPort stuff getting in the way or if the UPnP doesn't work, but whatever.  I actually prefer to manually configure my routers.<br /><br />Two things would make this camera better: PoE so you can put them in remote locations and a zoom lens.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a bargain for the price.",12-07-2014

Is it worth $45? Yes -- As long as you aren't expecting something that you just plug in and works.<br /><br />A couple of things to note:<br /><br />1) When you plug it into the router, it may not show up in the Foscam IP scanner. I thought I had a bad camera until I realized that their software just doesn't work. To initially find your camera, use this tool: http://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/<br /><br />2) Quality isn't great. If you have it set 15-20 feet from a doorway or someplace you want to monitor, you can probably see the face of someone clearly enough to identify them. Much further than that and you're going to be SOL.<br /><br />3) The built in motion detection is highly sensitive to changes in light, even on the lowest sensitivity setting. Not a huge deal, but can get kind of annoying if you keep checking your phone because of motion alarms.<br /><br />4) The alarm services (in which it emails you 6 pictures on motion / sound detection) seems to always miss the &#34;good parts.&#34; So if I'm testing it out I enable the alarm, walk outside, wait a minute, and then walk back in through the door. It takes 6 random pictures, so there is no guarantee you're going to be looking at the camera when it takes a picture. After I did this a couple of times, I found that the pictures were identifiable about 50% of the time.<br /><br />-- Solutions to topics 3 & 4: I recommend using a program like iSpy to monitor the camera. It's software is more advanced than what is built in.",03-07-2014

I do use it outside mounted under a dry spot of the house. I have been unable to get some of the functions like FTP to work so I mainly use it for a live feed or to e-mail me shots when motion is detected.

I am a novice at computer stuff. I struggled for about 2 weeks to get it to work. I was under the impression that since I bought it on Amazon and not directly from Foscam that I have to pay for technical service. I chose to attempt it myself. Im pretty sure I got it to work by luck. Once I got it to work, its a GREAT camera. I used the app to log in remotely, but that too was extremely difficult for me. Again, luck and help from the NO-IP representative got me thru that. The pan tilt and zoom is crystal clear. The alarms work perfectly. I use it to keep an eye on my dogs. The only down side to this camera, with no fault of the camera is the set up. Although Foscam has detailed videos and good instructions, I found it to be extremely difficult. Even after watching the videos multiple times, I still have no idea what an IP or a DDNS is.<br />I recently had to change my router, so I am without the camera working and I am probably going to hire someone because I can't figure it out.<br />Its a great camera.

What that helped me with as understanding the directions. Even so, I still had a few issues and had to walk away from it for an hour, then return and check all my settings and restart my router/computer. MY hangup was getting it to be viewable from the internet. It setup perfect and fast on the internal home network. But I was stuck on the internet thing until I took a break.<br />I didnt have to call tech support. I followed the directions step by step,. Its not HD, but I just wanted to get the whole process figured out before I invested too much money in it.<br />At this point, I'm ready to add 3 more cameras. I've got the hang of it.  The picture is quite reasonable for non HD. The camera pans and tilts nicely. Very easily mounted on my garage wall I'd say maybe 75' from the router and behind 3 walls, out in the garage. Connection appears perfect.<br /><br />My last advice is if you think you have all your settings correct, CHECK them again, restart your router, then restart your computer. Follow the directions line by line. You should be good. I've only had this an afternoon, so I'll update if anything else comes up. Be patient.<br /><br />UPDATE July 7: Just installed my second camera. It was a breeze. I now have two going on my phone, tablet, and tower computer. The software that comes with it works nicely. It does all I need it to do. Allows multiple cameras and viewing from the internet.<br />Setup is really EASY. When setting up to view from the net you MUST do these things. Assign a port number in the setup page on the IP cameratool. You can assign almost anything. Try 8000, then make the next camera 8001, and so on. NOW, you have a camera with an ip address that is YOUR home IP address followed by :8000 or :8001. That now becomes the IP address of the camera. Go to Starbucks. Type your IP address in with the colon/port number (your ip:8000). There you go. You get the login screen. Log into the camera.<br />If you want to use the software that comes with it, add the camera with that SAME number.<br />I admit I was a bit stumped on the first one, but after playing with it for a week, then adding the scond camera, its a breeze for THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE SOME CONCEPT OF NETWORKING!!!!!!  If you dont, either hire someone or dont buy this camera.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've since added 3 more of these. And as I said, if you understand what you are doing, you'll be fine. but it is NOT for the average non networking person. You MUST understand how to allow ports through your router IF you want to setup viewing from your phone in a remote location. I use an Android app called IP Cam Viewer Basic. You have to pay 2.99 if you want to use the sound and mic features. Well worth it. The app is excellent. I would not advise the Foscam app as they try to bait you into another app that requires you to &#34;login&#34; with an email. No thank you.<br />I am completely satisfied with the price, setup and use of these cameras. Just ordered another anf a friend of mine ordered one based on my recommendations.e camera.

From reading those reviews I was aware that it might require a little extra work, and it did.  I watched the various set up videos from Foscam on YouTube, and was able to set the camera up twice.  Twice because after the first set up I was suddenly unable to reach it from outside of my WiFi network.  After the second set up, I believe the first time it went down was due to my internet provider changing my IP.  Setup includes the basic setup and control, which included updating the firmware (be careful to choose the correct firmware to replace the one currently on your camera).  Then you can set up the camera so it will can work wireless, and this isn't much different from connecting your smartphone or laptop to your wireless network.  The third set up allows you to view the camera from outside of your wireless by setting up your router to port forward.  This will allow you to view the camera from an internet browser anywhere, or to use an iphone or android app to view the camera.  I am using IP Cam Soft to view the camera, and it works great.  So it's not plug and play, but the extra effort makes using the camera that much easier.  I have it set up to email me when motion is detected, which was another video from Foscam.  If you have the patience, this is an inexpensive IP camera option to help you keep an eye on things.  If you are using this camera and you suddenly can no longer view it outside of your network, check to see if your provider changed your IP address.  So far it has been well worth my investment.",18-06-2014

The pan/tilt feature is really helpful, and the quality of the video is sufficient for you to check them online or on a mobile device. The voice feature (which allows the user to hear the room being monitored, and to talk to back to it) is not as good as I expected, so I would not recommend the camera to someone that would really need this feature to work perfectly. I never tried to use it as a baby monitor, but would suspect that within the same network (and using your mobile device as the monitoring device) it would work better. For home monitoring it is definitely worth buying.",17-06-2014

It didnt scan after trying several times. Called customer care, spent 2 hours. They basically do a set list of things. they try. 1.) Disconnect your antenna, network cable and power cable. Reboot again after reconnecting everything. Didn't work. Next tried firmware upgrade. Did that, didnt work. Next tried hard resetting the camera, didnt work. Finally after 2 hours she gave up and said camera is faulty. I called again to get another opinion. This time the rep remote logged in my computer and basically did the same things again. Didnt work. After one hour he asked me to replace the camera. The first rep didnt give me any ticket number or anything .. just said email replacement. The 2nd rep did give me a ticket number. I have emailed them. Will update here how it goes further.    UPDATE : 3rd-September-2014  So the camera was promptly replaced. And the 2nd camera works very well. No hassles. Worked from the word go. It's been more than 2 months now and we use this camera everyday. Hasn't stopped or given any trouble. It's a little effort to set up the camera first and to update the software but after that it works smoothly. We use it with our apple and android devices. So initially the Foscam app for phone didnt work and I thought it was faulty and i got this app \\""ipcamsoft\\"". Works very well for free with a  small adv on top of screen. It doesn't let you talk back though. Later I figured out that just changing from high def to standard def makes the Foscam app works. Now I use Foscam's app and it works perfectly fine. It lets you talk back. The only thing it tells me is that it cannot do is record my video. But for that i have the other app.",17-06-2014

Foscam charged $7 for a return fee, then never sent the replacement...  Then the second one followed the same failure pattern.<br /><br />After weeks went by, I finally called and was told the replacement hadn't been shipped because I hadn't forwarded the email to Foscam that showed I had paid the $7 fee.  That's right, after I paid Foscam the $7, someone else at Foscom had to be notified  --by me--  that I had paid that $7 before my RMA replacement was shipped.  After that mildly irate phone call I was told they'll be sending it today.

I noticed no picture quality difference so I returned the contrast setting to 4 after the reboot.<br /><br />I am finding this 640 x 480 quality camera perfect for basic surveillance and security.  It has an excellent mounting bracket and utility/control program.  I mounted it on the ceiling upside down.  The daylight picture quality is adequate and the nighttime infared (doesn't work through windows) is surprisingly good IMHO for such a relatively cheap camera that has two way audio.  The 270 degree rotation plus the up and down range provides an ample range of view.  I was able to figure out how to setup remote viewing by using the port forwarding instructions provided on the website.  The wait for tech support was surprisingly short.  I actually was able to speak to a live person from some offshore help desk.  My questions were pretty basic but I was able to get everything setup and running with a matter of a couple of hours.  I had to hop in my car and drive to an internet café to confirm the remote viewing.  I couldn't confirm remote access in my house.  Doh!  I followed the security advice and purchased a DDNS provider for $19.95 per year to get a unique web address (no need to make things easy for hackers that flock to the free Foscam DDNS site).  The basic utility that allows you to setup users with ADMIN, OPERATOR, or VISITOR levels of access along with their passwords is pretty straight forward.  All this for about $70 plus the $19.95/yr for a unique DDNS.  In short, I am pleasantly surprised how easy it is to do this for such little money.<br /><br />Additional note on the Freezing Issue:  The Contrast is set to 4 and it works fine (backyard/garden/trees view).  I experienced the freezing and reboot when I set the contrast to 6.  It gave some warning signs when part of the picture started to freeze.  I set the contrast back down to 4 when it rebooted itself.  Given that I saw no discernible difference between a contrast of 4 and 6 (looking through a window to the outside) I am not concerned.  The indoor picture quality is acceptable.  Given the slow internet in my area and my desire to add additional cameras, I am happy with the 640 x 480 quality.  People looking for HD video surveillance should look elsewhere.",07-06-2014

After much consideration, I decided to start with this camera.  Not one of my smarter choices, as it turns out.  First of all, in order to use all of its features controls, you must use Internet Explorer. Firefox and Chrome will operate some, but not all of them.  Secondly, while the camera does have infrared capabilities, the default setting is ON.  You can manually turn it off, but any time the camera reboots (such as during a power loss), the infrared comes back on.  I wanted to install one of the cameras so it was aimed through a window into another, dimly lit, room.  Without the infrared, the camera did an adequate job of showing an image of the room.  With the infrared on, there was nothing but a huge glare off the glass.  Like most products imported from the Far East, the included instructions are a mess of gibberish and broken English making setup a challenge, especially if the user is not a tech wiz at routers, port forwarding, and networking.  You can remotely view the camera over the internet on a smart phone or tablet, however the Android version of the Foscam app falls short of the mark.  Don't waste time on it, there are other third party apps that do a much better job.  Getting assistance from the web site is a waste of time.  They devout a lot of space to marketing information about all of their products, but next to nothing in the way of on-line help.  Calling the tech support phone number is like watching grass grow.  Two different days, waiting over 30 minutes each time, and still no live person to talk to.  Email is no better, after three days, still no response.

The existing system has outdoor cameras covering all outside doors. I found an app for my iphone (ICam) for $4.99 that would allow me to turn my existing computer USB cameras into security cameras and display them on my phone. Being the geek that I am, this turned into experimenting with wireless cameras in other rooms. After reading several reviews it came down to Airlink101 and the Forscam F18910W.  I purchased one of each to compare. The Forscam came first so I worked on the first. It was so easy to configure that I decided not to even spen any time on the Airlink.  Besides the Forscam was om Amazon prime so it came in 2 days as apposed to over a week with the Airlink. When it came to figuring the camera to work outside of my local network, I decided to call tech support instead of spending hours on my own. I spoke with John Davis at Forscam in India. He was one of the best techs I have spoken to in a long time. He was easy to follow, professional and curious. Above all he was knowledgable. He was patient an allowed me to create screen captures along the way so I could create instruction for installation of the next three I decided to add. I highly recomend this product as well as Amazon Prime. I have since returned the Airlink and besides the hassle of dealing with the vendor, I had to pay $3.00 in shipping to get it and $17.00 to sent it back!  Never again will I buy any not part of Prime and not handled by Amazon. Thanks Forscam and Thank Amazon.",17-05-2014

You cannot rely a 100% on it,"The camera itself it’s not something you can trust in. It needs to get a reboot every once in a while; maybe every 4 or 5 days. Otherwise it just stops transmitting.  You can even see the green light on the back (the one that means that there is a data flow between the device and the router) stops tilting. There were many times when I went out and I couldn’t watch my home because of this. I know friends with other cameras that have been working for hundreds of days, or even years without any stop whatsoever.<br /><br />It takes at least some medium knowledge in computers to configure the camera and the Router.  But that’s not the problem.<br /><br />Some things that are remarkable on this camera:<br />- Night Vision works great even in big areas<br />- Motion sensor works very well. It gets it almost every time<br />- The eMail alert on motion is great!<br />- The field of view of the lens is pretty decent. (not too narrow)<br />- The presets you can configure for the camera.",01-05-2014

My only gripe is that when talking through the camera it sometimes cuts off the first and last few words and there is a noticeable delay (with both the browser interface and the tinyCam app). You can avoid cutting off words by waiting a couple seconds to start talking and holding the button a little while after you're done.<br /><br />Put a temperature probe on this and it would be an amazing baby monitor.,27-04-2014

If not applied correctly, the WIFI option will be lost forever.<br />- The control interface is like a visit back to the 1990s. It is clumsy, often obnoxious and non-intuitive.<br />- After a few months of ownership, I am seeing degradation in the mechanical aspects of the camera. I expect failure at some point.<br />- I am just guessing here, but it seems the vid quality took a back seat to the mechanical aspects (pan, tilt etc).<br />- There is no zoom.<br />- The resolution is limited to 640x480<br />- It is bulky and hard to mount.<br />- It is very conspicuous.<br /><br />So overall it works, but it could be so much more.

There's a definite caveat that applies to all IP webcams - you're going to have to be ok with getting inside the configuration of your Router. I found a useful guide in the instructions for my Apple Airport, but I still had to understand that the camera required a fixed IP address, and had to figure that out (it's not rocket-science at all). Ultimately many of the common questions can be answered with a simple web query, so someone probably has the answer.

This is obviously a problem if you are not within earshot of a screaming baby. The other problem we had was when you try an speak with the two way voice communications, the software doesn't automatically mute microphone on the camera so you end up getting feedback and eventually the camera is screaming like a dying hyena. My wife started laughing like crazy when I tried asking if she needed help and the camera was just screaming electronic cuss words at her. I had no idea what was going on until I heard it myself when I was close by the camera.<br /><br />Anyway, because most people will skip over the blurb above, here is a quick summary.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Picture quality will do<br />Night vision is pretty good.<br />definitely quiet movement.<br />application is mostly user friendly. (I'm pretty tech savvy though)<br />sturdy build.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Audio stops on some android phones once screen is turned off.<br />Lack of muting on camera side when using two way communications causes horribly loud sounds coming from camera.<br /><br />If Foscam could fix these two bugs and make this camera more reliable, it would be a great inexpensive baby monitor.<br /><br />Note: My sister has the step down from this version and has had no problem with audio issues above. But, given my experience, I can't give this a very high rating.",10-04-2014

But, there have been some issues...<br />Pros:<br />1. Video quality is great for surveillance; don't be expecting to record and HD movie<br />2. The night vision works great and reaches to the end of my driveway and into the street a little<br />3. Set up was super easy and it is very customizable<br />4. Pan and tilt functions work flawlessly<br />5. Wireless connectivity is an added bonus<br /><br />First of all, I know that this is and indoor camera, but I have kept it outside for over 7 months with now issues. To protect it from the elements I mounted underneath the eve of my house so that no rain can get to it. It has survived the winter (dropping well below 15 degrees) and the summer. I started out having the camera connect to my network wirelessly because it was convenient, but I the quality of the video suffered a little bit. I then hard-wired it to my router and then the quality was perfect! I've only had two issues. First, the wireless module stopped working (It would not find any networks). It may be because I had it outside and the cold messed up the wireless module, but I already had it hardwired so it didn't matter to me. The only other issue that I have is the FPS (Frames Per Second). I use a program called ISpy to record my camera. I started noticing that the FPS was very low with this program (It was 4 FPS). I asked Foscam support about it and they said it has something to do with the way they program their cameras. They said they would eventually have a fix for it, but nothing yet. I managed to get the FPS up to 15-16 on the ISpy program and that is satisfactory for me!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Low FPS with some 3rd party programs<br />2. Wireless connectivity",07-04-2014

Setup took a bit longer than I'd like, but gets easier each time I perform a reset on the camera.  I've tried several differnet apps on my iphone, ipad, and old andriod phone. (I've spent over $20 on apps)  All experience the same thing, so I know it's the camera.  Sometimes it works great, but then connection will drop and it can take anywhere from 30-60 minutes to get a good connection again.  Then it drops again shortly afterwards, cycle repeats.  Rarely will this ever work for 60 straight minutes.  It's not consistent and provides no ease of mind, especially at night when I'm trying to sleep because I have no way of knowing it's not working without picking up my ipad or iphone.  I even bought a wifi repeater and tried using that.  Same issue.  When I called tech support, their simple answer is perform a hard reset (button on the bottom) even though I'd already done that.  I've tried google to find answers.  I've updated firmware, etc.  I'm not sure how this camera gets such good reviews. I'm also not sure how people keep saying tech support (and giving their name) was a great help.  Seems like bogus reviews if you ask me.

(This was warned about in one of the featured reviews.)<br /><br />If you set the camera to full resolution (640x480) with the standard brightness and contrast under bright outdoor conditions, it causes the camera to crash and reboot (especially when panning).<br /><br />So, normally, I keep the camera set to 320x240 (it lowers the bandwidth used by the cameras, too).  I will perform any panning in the low res mode, then kick up to full resolution once pointed at my intended subject.<br /><br />However, I find that if I lower the brightness and/or contrast, I can keep the camera set to full resolution without any crashes.<br /><br />Tips: If you are going to use this camera for bright, detailed outdoor viewing, keep it in low res, or lower your brightness to 5 and/or your contrast to 2.

It also has a web interface that does work on both the local network and port forwarding thru the router.  From time to time it will reset, which causes the pan/tilt position to randomize, but the web interface has a control to fix it (presets don't seem to work when this happens.. in that they don't auto-move to your preset position when it goes funky, like it does if there is a power loss/reset).

You can control pan and tilt from your PC (or other device) as well as change the administrative settings (with a username/password.)<br /><br />The device can, on alert, send images to e-mail accounts or if you set up a FTP location, to a folder on a FTP drive.  The alert can be on motion and/or sound.  I have tried all of these options with success.  I have found for me that the e-mail on alert is best to my liking.  You get an alert and a picture as soon as a motion or sound triggers it.<br /><br />Another feature that takes a little more technical skill to set up is the ability to access the camera from any location on the internet.  The setup on the camera is fairly easily but on your router, you will need to modify settings to allow the camera to be accessible through the internet.  In normal operations, your router would block these type of access attempts as a security measure.  You can selectively allow allow open ports to access the camera and keep your LAN secure.  There are decent instructions in the manual that makes this setup easier.  I also tried this function and it works great as well.  It is very nice to be able to look over your house when you are away from home.<br /><br />The infrared works very well also for night pictures.<br /><br />The picture resolution is as stated in the specifications.  If you want a higher resolution image, you should look at the more expensive version of this camera.<br /><br />Last point is that there are several free apps on the apple store for the FOSCAM that allows you to view up to 8 cameras.  If you have an iPhone or iPad, these making viewing multiple cameras very nice and an improvement over using a browser.<br /><br />I have had the camera for about 6 weeks - I am pleased with the operations and functionality.

I was a little wary due to the reviews, but now I'm ready to declare, I like this camera and it's been working for me so far. Bought almost 2 months ago.<br /><br />This camera runs 24/7 and it has provided faultless service. I have received notifications regarding firmware updates but have not installed them yet. I'm currently on firmware:  11.37.2.52. I'll have to check the forums to see if there are any issues with the updates.<br /><br />Never forward things like this over the internet. You should always remote in using an encrypted connection before connecting to the camera, whether it's a VPN on your router or using Teamviewer to get on a computer at home, then viewing the camera. The lack of security is not worth the convenience.<br /><br />I was already using iSpy before I purchased this camera so I have not bothered with whatever software/monitoring/alerting it has. I have used the web interface locally and had no problem getting the sound to work to listen.<br /><br />I would like to put this outside under a porch, but not sure how it'll hold up, I guess the only issue it could face would be due to humidity? That and thieves or vandals, I read that if you have it behind glass, the IR doesn't work. Lame.<br /><br />One major problem is that I am now addicted to looking at my house when I'm gone. I constantly want to pull things up and check the cameras (even though I have alerts set). It's too much fun to play with the camera and move it around... it could really affect my work if I get more of these cameras.<br /><br />I'll update if there are any issues with the camera in the near future, but I give it a thumbs up.

Once I realized this limitation, the only place I could safely put it was in my crawlspace, to watch the mice activity.

Messed with these things for a few days before deciding to return them. I had done alot of research on which camera would serve my needs of security, I only wanted to monitor my home while i was away via my phone. One reason i chose these was not having to sign up for a cloud service. Turns out my Belkin router will only let me use a service they recommend which cost after the free trial. Now that's not Foscams fault but i feel it should have been noted at some point. As for the cameras they were no where near the quality i expected and the image quality was bad after about 15 to 20 feet away (from the camera i put in my living room i couldnt even read the writing on a box that was in my kitchen about 13 feet away , So unless a thief sticks his face right up to the camera i doubt if i could even get a good look.

Prader-Willi is a genetic disorder - people with PWS have an insatiable appetite and cannot control themselves around food.  If you came to our home you would find our all the food in our house under lock and key.<br /><br />My wife and I wanted to leave our 12 year old PWS child alone for a bit, but wanted the security of being able to watch the kitchen to make sure she did not eat (even with the food under lock and key).  It was very easy to set up and configure.  I already have a Synology NAS, so I connected the camera and set it up to record when it identified movement.<br /><br />Little did I know that this would also catch our 9 year old son trying to take the laptop up to his room after his bed time.  As you can see from the video, I did not hide the camera and he knew right where it was located.  He made a wise choice and only displayed a little bit of attitude.",13-03-2014

Forget it!,"I tried a few days to get this item to work on Mavericks.  Thinking there was some trick that I must have missed.  The first part, I purchased this like new off Amazon, with a few minor imperfections.  When it came it had no installation CD.  I went to the foscam website, thinking perhaps like other customers, they might help.  Those reviews must be bots, because in a week I have yet to find any customer service rep available by chat.  I called in but they couldn't really assist me with connecting me to someone via chat to screenshare or anything else another reviewer said.  Maybe they were lucky.  I wasn't.  So there aren't really any tutorials for this model and maverick and I eventually gave up.  Amazon will not send the installation CD, and the ip find tool just never worked once.  So I sent this back and got the plug and play 21P.  There's zero information about the 21P's, its all 21W and I was hesitant.<br /><br /> software for mac is only the IP tool on the CD.  But I plugged the thing in my router, and viola, it appeared.  And it was pretty easy after that.  I still have a sneaking suspicion that there's software out there that gives you one price and then after you purchase you see lower prices.  I'm still convinced this is the case, with this particular 10W purchase, and had to buy one a double the price just to find one that worked on my mac.  The 21P works great, but don't put it behind glass for the night.  I don't know what on earth you would use to use the IR at night in a case, none seem to offer any help case wise and renders the feature completely useless.  The browser software does not accept USB camera's that I can figure out.  IP addy or not.  But it does accept multiple camera's for the 21p if you do not wish to convert a usb that I'm aware of.  I never got to see for the 10W :(/  I used evocam, and i got usb, FaceTime and this camera up and going.  Plug & Play is the way to go.",13-03-2014

Don't expect a Mercedes for a Hyundai price.,"I find this to be a great webcam.  It's resolution is pretty good.  At 640X480 resolution, the frame rate I get over the internet is very low, down at 5 fps for my MacPro and sometimes 1 fps for my Samsung Notepad.  But as I said, don't expect a Mercedes for a Hyundai price.<br /><br />The controls from the webpage works pretty good.  You can set options, and do controls okay.  My Android phone uses a paid Foscam App and IPCam (for free) which works much better in terms of control layout.  But you don't need to pay $2.99 for an App.  The benefits are marginal.<br /><br />Set up was pretty easy.  For those that have had trouble probably didn't read the instructions.  The only tough part was setting up the Verizon Fios port forwarding.  It took at least 5 minutes to do a Google search to figure it out.<br /><br />I have dynamic DDNS service, but used the IP address and the 4 digit port I set up.  It's been a week and the public IP address hasn't changed.  I was starting to use the public IP forwarding service, but figured that for the infrequent times that my dynamic IP changes (I got it a month ago, and hasn't changed yet), that when it does change, I'll just cross the bridge when I come to it and change the IP address when I log in.<br /><br />You can turn on the IR light remotely.  You can control the camera direction by clicking on a control and on touch pads, swipe with your finger.  There are 8 preset positions which are great, and you can set it to automatically sweep vertically or horizontally.<br /><br />A great feature is a motion sensor that when triggered, will send by e-mail 6 pics from the camera.  I use it with my security system.<br /><br />There is a feature that periodically allows video to upload to an FTP service, but Verizon doesn't allow FTP hosting so I haven't been able to get it to work.  But, from your app or webpage create snapshots and videos.<br /><br />Finally, the apps allow you to view several cameras at the same time.  I haven't triedit because I only have one cam, but since several apps have it and you can view one window which the other(s) with no signal, I assume it should work.<br /><br />In summary, it has great features and it seems to work well.  If you want an inexpensive camera that can work wirelessly and over the internet that has a host of practical features, this is it.  If you want a professional grade camera, this is not for you.  You need a camera that costs hundreds of dollars.  I think it's not fair to give a Toyota Camry a lower rating just because it doesn't have the features and performance of a Bentley.",07-03-2014

You can also remotely capture and record stills and video through your computer or smartphone control panel.

In my case, if I point it outside, even with brightness turned down very low on the camera's settings, the camera's firmware crashes, making a manual reboot necessary and not capturing any images during that time. This is obviously a problem since that is precisely why I bought the camera, and I don't want to have to constantly worry that pointing it at the wrong kind of scene might cause it to malfunction (and what if I'm away from home and can't reboot it to &#34;fix&#34; the problem temporarily?). I had a similar problem with a D-Link camera that I bought, and I'm still looking for a suitable camera that doesn't have this problem. I thought I would be lucky with this one; I was not. It was also unable to connect to my WiFi (and I don't even have spaces or odd characters in my SSID or password), so I was stuck using Ethernet.<br /><br />The small subset of this camera's features that I was able to explore seem in line with other cameras at similar pricepoints: optional recording on motion detecting, ability to e-mail images or upload to FTP server, and so on. Unfortunately, because of the major problem I just mentioned, I didn't get to test these features much. It also seems to be missing the ability to record actual video instead of a series of JPEGs, but that also seems pretty common with less expensive cameras like this.",06-03-2014

It worked very smoothly using a local Web browser on my laptop, and it worked very well using one of several Android apps remotely from my smartphone.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it suffered from a known issue described elsewhere in these reviews: When the camera was pointed a a very bright scene, it would reboot causing it to go offline for a while, and then go through its initial &#34;pan around everywhere&#34; routine until it would finally settle at the first preset. I had it pointing at some dog crates near a bright window, so it would just continually reboot and reboot rendering it useless.<br /><br />I contacted Foscam Support, and they quickly diagnosed the issue. The fix was to get a replacement camera. I was still within the Amazon return period, so I could return it for an exchange, otherwise I could get an RMA from Foscam directly and have them replace it. Given the number of occurrences of this issue here on Amazon, I had no guarantee that a replacement from Amazon would not have the same issue, so I opted for the RMA directly from Foscam since they assured me that the replacement would work properly.<br /><br />I sent it back, and in about a week, I received a replacement. I installed it, and it now works reliably pointing to the same bright scene that caused the other camera to fail.<br /><br />I'm giving it only 4 stars because the camera did have a known issue, and I did have to pay extra shipping to send it back for the RMA. But other than that, I have to give this camera very high marks.

The main letdown is the control panel which varies from Explorer to Chrome to Mobile. Each one with less features than the other. However the big miss here is the patrol option. This camera will only let you patrol horizontally and/or vertically, but not to your presets. If you are not able to patrol through the preset spots then why even bother to let you set them??? The importance of presets is for you to choose exactly which places are you most interested in watching, so to let you select them but not patrol them is plainly nuts.

For the rest of us - including the day-to-day computer-savvy types who can normally download apps, install plug-ins, etc. - this thing doesn't work.  Also, despite advertisement on the box to the contrary, this DOES NOT have two-way audio for Macs.<br /><br />First, I tried the instructions.  Got one step in, and they didn't work.  To Foscam's credit, their customer service is 24/7, and they picked up relatively quickly (the first two times).  Each time I called, we solved for the very next step.  Hence, after three calls (the 3rd one was a ~25 minute wait), I got it to work, only by their tech support VPN'ing in (each of the 3 times) to my computer, installing and configuring plug-ins, including a plug-in (VLC) to *separately* operate the audio (1 way for the MAC, two ways for my android phone); audio never worked for the iPhone - maybe it could, but I was out of patience for a 4th call.

The &#34;most helpful critical reviewer&#34; makes a very valid point, and if that problem is persisting then heed his advice, but it is one that many of the people who negatively reviewed this camera are not coming into contact with.<br /><br />I purchased this camera for home security purposes and as far as I am concerned it performs flawlessly. The live feed, motion detection, infrared functionality, silent alarm system (as well as the SMTP mail server functionality), free DDNS service, and FTP upload all work as intended. The main reason that I'm docking a single star for this device is because the setup can be excruciating; a reboot of the device is required following every major change made to its function, and if you're enabling all of the above settings like I did, you'll be rebooting this device many times during setup. The device is also slow to connect to a wireless network - the instructions suggest waiting up to a minute for it to connect properly before attempting to access it - but once this waiting period is over it responds rapidly and as it should.<br /><br />The main problem with this device seems to be the fact that its webUI is not very user friendly. This is true to some extent, but once you start meandering into the realm of do-it-yourself home security, some tech knowledge should be a given. Docking stars for an item too complicated for you to use seems somewhat foolish; the functionality still exists, but because the users here seem to be unable to delve into it they are saying it's a lousy product, which is untrue. This also applies for firmware upgrades. Yes you are required to upgrade two sets of firmware for this camera to get it to work as best it can, but this is no different than updating drivers on a computer hardware, or installing regular updates on aPC. As time goes by firmwares age and need to be replaced, this is a fact of the technology age we live in. I would be upset with a product that DIDN'T require you to update firmware out of the box, because this means, among other things, that they've likely stopped updating the firmware, and the functionality of the device is not being optimized.<br /><br />I have also read reviews that complain about the DDNS service offered to you through the device, claiming that they felt it was unsafe. Registering a DDNS is not unsafe in and of itself, primarily because knowing about the DDNS does not give somebody access to your home network any more than knowing your IP address does. This is also ironic, because the DDNS functionality is probably one of the easier things about this camera to configure, yet the people here having difficulty configuring the camera were upset about its inclusion. However, accessing this camera via the provided DDNS is not the only way to do so remotely, because as anybody who has registered a DDNS knows, it simply reroutes a customized web address to your IP address. I use another DDNS that I already had registered to access my cameras, and simply leave the one that came included with the camera deactivated. All of the remote functionality is exactly the same.<br /><br />I mean no offense to other reviewers, but I felt that my experience with the camera needed to be cataloged. If you are technology impaired, this might not be the camera for you as so many of these other reviews have experienced first hand. If, however, you are fully capable of managing your own home network and router via a webUI and understand the basics of port forwarding, I'm confident you'll be able to unravel the mystery that is the FOSCAM FI8910W, assuming their quality control issue has been reigned in (having not come across that issue myself, I can't comment on it here).",03-03-2014

It does take a little knowledge of computer network setup to make a quick install but the installation guide that comes with it does a pretty good job of walking you through set up if you have never done it before.  I can now check in on my place from my iphone or ipad anytime. It also allows you to listen to the sound around it and speak through the camera if you have a fast enough connection when monitoring.

Our building is probably 150-175 ft. from the house, so I liked the idea of wireless viewing AND the night vision.  BUT...between the metal walls/roofing of our building and our router location (in our basement - for various reasons not easy to relocate),  we could not get a strong enough signal (even with a range extender placed upstairs) to go wireless.<br /><br />So we purchased 250 ft. of outdoor rated cat5 cable ($45 including shipping, which was less than the cost of the range extender I'd purchased, and later returned).  We ran that out to the building (buried) and the camera works just fine.  The night vision works well, the colors of day vision are true, and the sound carries easily.  As far as I know, this is not an outdoor rated camera, but I have it up in the rafters, well under roof, so I'm hoping it will be fine.  Time will tell.  My husband keeps saying he wishes it had a zoom feature, and I agree.  But for the price, I think it's a pretty good deal!",02-03-2014

Since getting this camera, there have been numerous naps and bedtimes which I would have interfered with based on the sounds from the monitor, but being able to see what she's doing has given her a chance to fall asleep on her own without me messing her up.  Makes me wonder if part of her sleeping troubles now are because I went in too often before she had a chance to get herself settled.  Also, good for safety as she rolls herself onto her tummy and gets stuck there and very mad.  Great for knowing when to go in and when to let her work herself out!",28-02-2014

However, when I tried to then connect it to my iPhone, to be able to use the remote viewing capability -- wow! What a nightmare! First, when you try to access the Mac version of the instructions on the included DVD or on the website, that section has may things that refer to a Windows environment. Huh? The process of porting your iPhone to try and connect to this webcam is ridiculously difficult, and even after 35 minutes on the phone with the Foscam tech support person (who had to take control of my Mac temporarily), it didn't work. But that didn't stop the tech person from trying to convince me to go into Amazon while he waited, and give him a good review! I admire this person's spirit, but it came across as quite pushy, especially since he wasn't able to get the unit to work properly. It was very difficult to understand the Foscam tech support person, due to a very heavy non-English accent. I'm sorry but that's the fact, and it definitely made the process harder.

Although this camera is new, it appears to be well made and for a security camera has a great picture and features like recording, audio, snapshot that I would expect to find in much more expensive cameras.",17-02-2014

If your residential ISP only offers a dynamic WAN IP address, you will have to subscribe to a DDNS service to provide you a fixed host and domain name.

Upon opening the box I was pleased with the look and feel of the hardware.  I plugged it in and was able to successfully configure the network interfaces.  The picture was OK and perfectly acceptable considering that it is VGA resolution with a CMOS image sensor.  If the software was a nice as the hardware (again...considering the price for the hardware comment) I would have rated the camera 5 stars.  The problem came when I tried to really use the camera with my browser of choice (Firefox).<br /><br />I found the camera to work acceptably well with Internet Explorer.  The web interface for IE uses ActiveX for displaying the video.  It was pretty snappy and the video was OK.  When I tried the &#34;server push&#34; interface which is intended for use with other browsers  the camera &#34;bombed&#34;  Even though the computer and camera were plugged into the same 100MB network switch the user interface kept freezing up.  I tried this with multiple computers including a 3ghz quad core windows 7 box but the results were the same.  Sometimes when panning stopped the image would retain motion blur from the last frame sent (I think that they use MJPG downloads for video).  The &#34;killer problem&#34; with this device is that after  a short period of use, the video stops working all together and there is an icon of a  &#34;broken document with an X &#34; where the video should be.  Once this happens the device has to be rebooted to get it to work again.  I tried it on several computers with the same results so the problem was definitely with the camera.<br /><br />I contacted Foscam support and their technician logged onto my computer remotely and when I showed her the problem she said that the only way to fix it was to run the camera at 320X240 resolution or to use internet explorer.<br /><br />I really wish that this had worked out for me because I still like the camera design and ergonomics.  Sadly, I just boxed it up and returned it because I don't, won't, and can't run Internet explorer.  Furthermore even if I could run IE  I can't count on everyone who will onto this camera to do the same.<br /><br />So...if you are the sole user of the device and always use internet explorer I could recommend this camera.  Otherwise, don't buy it.",11-02-2014

Over-night the camera worked well and I had a new-found insight into the nocturnal life of our cat (bathing, sleeping, occasionally running like crazy).<br /><br />The next morning, before work, I setup the camera to point out of a front window as I wanted to monitor the mailbox and various deliveries throughout the day. Once at work I connected to the camera to see what was going and was confused to find that I'd get a few frames of video and then lose connection. I initially blamed this on my phone and the WiFi signal at the office, as when I got home in the evening the camera was working perfectly again.<br /><br />It wasn't until the next day that I was able to observe the camera first-hand running during daylight. When the camera was facing the interior of the house it worked fine, but as soon as it was panned to point out the window it would immediately freeze. I was able to easily repeat this by holding the camera and manually pointing it out the window. Every time the bushes and grass came into shot the camera would freeze displaying a black frame. If the camera was quickly pointed away from the window it would recover and start streaming video, and once pointed back outside it would immediately lock up again.<br /><br />The only way I was able to operate the camera while pointing out of the front-window was to reduce the resolution down from 640x480 to 320x240. Once the resolution was reduced the camera worked perfectly, but the resolution was now so low it was impossible to identify anyone via the footage.<br /><br />When not freezing due to complex scenes the camera and it's PTZ mechanism worked well. When pointed out the window it failed dramatically.<br /><br />This camera didn't work for my intended use, I've now re-purposed it for use monitoring the interior of our home during the day and night. In this role it works perfectly.<br /><br />All-in-all this camera works well if you play to it's strengths.<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br />- Cheap<br />- Wireless<br />- Pan-Tilt-Zoom functionality<br />- Two-way audio<br /><br />CONs:<br /><br />- Completely freezes and reboots when displaying complex scenes<br />- Quite noisy image<br />- MJPEG is a horribly inefficient compression method which uses way more bandwidth than needed.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this three stars instead of less is that when running inside the home it works as expected.",09-02-2014

I am compelled to write one for this product as it is a piece of crap plain and simple and my hope is that if you have a project similar to mine (bird watching, pool area monitoring, etc.) you will be spared the frustration and stress of trying to make this camera work.  I just now read a review that tells me exactly why I see the problems I have been dealing with for weeks: bad firmware that places the camera firmware/hardware in an unknown state during which you'll pull out your hair trying to figure out what it's doing.  Black screens, frequent resets, etc.  Now certainly one could say &#34;well you bought an indoor camera for an outdoor application&#34; but it should not matter if the camera in in a weather tight housing (heat not an issue, at least not yet).  Wireless or wired ( I tested it in every possible configuration), the results are the same .... too much going on in the scene and the camera firmware goes belly up.  I've never tried to return anything to Amazon as I've been satisfied with all of my other purchases.  This is WORTH the hassle of boxing it all back up and taking time to ship it back.  I'm going to try and complete my project with another brand of IP camera, however I'm done with FOSCAM mostly because of the company's apparent lack of integrity: you just don't continue to manufacture and ship products with known defects like this.",08-02-2014

Based on this, I feel that the cameras are of good quality for the price you can get them for here on Amazon. I have seen the same cameras priced much higher elsewhere, so I'm glad I bought my F18910W's on amazon.com.<br /><br />The cameras come with a disk that installs a couple of different software utilities ... one of which is: Foscam IP Camera - I spent well over 2 hours trying to get this software to work  and finally emailed support - they were absolutely no help at all and told me I should use Blue Iris software (which is a $49.00 program that they sell). The Foscam IP Camera software does not even come with any documentation or help files. After trying to find anything of relevance on the forums and YouTube, etc. ... I gave up and purchased the Blue Iris software (more on that on my Blue Iris review).<br /><br />I did have a hardware problem with one out of the nine cameras and Amazon took care of this immediately upon receiving my email regarding the problem. I LOVE amazon.com ... they never fail to take care of any issues i have with anything.<br /><br />Now let me give you a little advice; don't make the same mistake that I made ... I was using one of the Foscam FI8910W to monitor my front yard/street. Because it was not an outdoor camera i had it inside just pointed out the window. Well, at night the IR (infrared) lights reflect off the window and the view is awful (extremely distorted). So I decided I would order the FI8919W outdoor camera. HERE'S WHERE I MADE MY MISTAKE ... I was given a coupon code that gave me a 10% off discount if i ordered the camera from the foscam.ca site, which I did, and I saved $16.50 off of the $165.00 price. WHAT A MISTAKE that was ... ordering from the Foscam.ca site. I checked the status of the order every day and it kept showing 'Processing' ... after a week I phoned them and was told the camera had already shipped and i should be getting tracking info shortly. Another day went by ... same thing ... phoned them and was told the camera shipped but still no tracking info. Then I emailed them and was told that the camera had not shipped and it was backordered. I told them I was furious at being mislead and to cancel my order. Within a half hour I received confirmation that they 'had just shipped' the order. I told them I needed this camera days ago and to expedite it ... they said 'too late' can't do anything about it now. O.M.GAAAAWD!!!!  What a horrible company.  I only wish I would have ordered this camera directly from amazon.com as I would have received it within two days (I ordered it on Jan 29th and according to the tracking it will not be here until Feb 13th). I am so disgusted with this company that I will never deal with them directly again ... and I wish i could find a comparable product just so I don't have to support their company again in the future.  Their tech support is horrible, their user guides are non-existent, and they intentionally mislead me.<br /><br />So in the end, let me say ... the cameras are okay; amazon.com is awesome as always; foscam.ca is the most unprofessional company I've ever dealt with.  In the end, if you buy their cameras you might want to check out their configuration videos at:<br />foscam.us  and search for  mjpeg-setup-videos",08-02-2014

One thing I did notice that sometimes my ISP will change my IP address periodically. While this will not affect local viewing from your network, you will need to change your &#34;away&#34; viewing by changing your IP address to correspond to your home router on your device or computer (eg, whatever IP camera apps you might use). This literally takes a minute or two, and you'll be able to see your camera again. Still will recommend, especially now that there's a $30 price drop from when I putchased it.  If you aren't using the camera as a wireless and strictly on your home network, you can &#34;plug and play&#34; and use the camera out of the box. However, if you are using this as a wireless IP camera that has a good picture and sound, it is definitely worth going through the port-forwarding setup. I don't consider myself tech savvy, but as intimidating as getting online and wireless sounds, it's not difficult. You will need to do your research (like being able to access the software inside your router, which can be found using Google-Fu), and follow the manual. Have patience, and it shouldn't take more than 20-30 minutes, even at a slow pace.  One thing that you need to remember once you set the camera up is that you'll have two ways to access it. From your home network, you'll use your local IP address, and while you're out, you need to use your internet IP address.  There are a lot of ways to get frustrated, but relax, and you'll get through it.  Once it's hooked up, the camera itself is very clear and has a microphone built-in, so you can listen while monitoring. It also has inputs and outputs for a microphone and speakers, so you can also talk through the camera to people that are in the room. I use IP Cam Viewer Lite, and I can listen and talk through my iPhone. I hooked up a small speaker to the camera so I can &#34;speak&#34; to it. Sometimes the audio may cut in and out, but that dependsmostly on your connection to the internet from your viewing device.  I haven't used the email alerts for motion-detection, so I can't comment on that. Bur for the money this was a great buy, and I would buy another one when I need to. I've had the camera connected for about 7 months now and it still works just as well as when I purchased it.",06-02-2014

I called customer service and spoke with Michelle Smith. I’m adding her name to the review because I realized other reviewers were right in commending the reps for dedication to customers. She remote onto my computer and setup everything in less than five minutes. I call customer service again one week later after I bought a new computer with bigger memory so I can have a dedicated computer to record videos from the camera.

Can check on my dogs anytime by using iphone or ipad apps or on any computer using the ip address and port for the camera.  Just know that for someone who is a complete tech novice, you will probably end up calling customer service for help at some point.  Basically there are 2 steps in set up: 1) get the camera on your wifi, and 2) set up port forwarding so you can view the camera's feed when you are not at home.  I followed all the steps in the manual to get the camera set up on my network, but I still couldn't get it to work wirelessly.  I called customer service and within a few minutes they had that working for me.  Getting the port forwarding to work was tougher.  Since I have a router from my cable company I had to use the IP address on the side of the router to access the router settings, and through some digging online I figured out how to set up port forwarding for the camera through the router.  I finally figured out that to view the camera using apps or using web browsers when not at home that I have to use my home IP address followed by the port number that I set up for the camera. Now everything is great.  I can even turn on the mic in my iphone app and talk through the camera when I'm not home, or turn on the audio and hear what's going on!",02-02-2014

Great for home security, etc. Baby viewing. Many uses. Be aware that if you intend to view these IP Cams remotely (iPhone, smart phone, remote internet connection) that you do need to know how to port forward from your WiFi router. Not a huge big deal & can be done easily, but with security of the connection in mind - MAKE SURE you do it right. Instructions are in broken english so they can be challenging. However if you, or a friend, has some knowledge of your WiFi internal settings, you can do it. There are a few good YouTube vid's on setting these up. They are better than the instructions. Also good tips on the FOSCAM site. You you've never tried them, you HAVE to get a few of these IP Cams. So much fun viewing what is going on an a few rooms of your home when you are away.<br /><br />However I'm not sure the HD cam's are worth the extra cost or bandwidth/response time remotely. I also bought the higher priced FI9821W V2 2-pack and they work well. I'm not sure they work ENOUGH better to make the trip, but they are HD and that seems like a must have right?<br /><br />This low def version has acceptable quality and IR operates about the same as HD models. Not quite as wide angle as the HD cams. In anything but perfect light the HD cams don't really come into their own. Often where you choose to place the cam, you have less than perfect light.<br /><br />I'm glad I have the 2-pack, but don't automatically shy away from these lower def ones. They are pretty capable. Software available is good. Tried them all. Steer clear of the FOSCAM smart phone app. You may find it in the App Store, but I don't think even FOSCAM recommends it. It doesn't operate all the controls of the newer IP cams, and somewhat limited on the older ones too. I ended up with LiveCam Pro and find it just what I was looking for in an iPhone app.<br /><br />I've only had them a few weeks, so I don't know if they will hold up. We'll see.

When it comes to IP video, most of the time, it's not the hardware, rather the qos of the network fueling the hardware.<br /><br />For corporate video conferencing, good qos means high end routers, gigabit switch ports, dedicated high bandwidth comm circuits, video/voice traffic isolation, and even data compression.  All of this costing at least 1k per month, depending on the level desired and budget.<br /><br />Now, Since these options aren't typically available for the home, we're limited to what our Internet service providers offer.  Mostly being that of increased Internet bandwidth.  For optimum, it's 'ultra', and for fios, it's 'quantum'.  For me, for just an extra $6 per month, my Internet speed service was essentially doubled, which is a no brainier.  Also look into static ip services, and higher end modems or routers if offered by your ISP.<br /><br />I also keep my IP cam hard wired, which contributes to higher connectivity stability and performance.  When wireless, there are several new things to consider for qos, so be weary of problems specific to the IP cam's wireless connectivity vs. hard wired.<br /><br />For those having issues even getting it up and running, or for those who want to research instalation steps before your IP cam even arives, which is what I did, search for your ip cam model in YouTube.  You will find several videos that walk you through the initial setup for local viewing and separate videos for advanced setup for remote viewing on your wireless devices.<br /><br />Just some general notes:<br />Make sure you have installed the latest firmware before settin up remote access.<br />Heavily password protect your ipcam and router before settinup remote access.<br />Setup the IP cam with a static ip address(i.e. don't let it use DHCP settin.<br />Don't setup the ip cam on port 80, use a different port.<br />Inbound audio works very well., but for baby monitoring, I will depend upon a separate audio specific monitor for when I'm sleeping.<br />Feedback is received if a remote device plays back inbound audio when near the IP cam.

The mistakes are glaring and it required 2.5 hours of trail and error configuring, hard resets and testing to get it to work.

Aside from the obvious differences in resolution and MJPG v H.264 this is a real problem child. Yes, it can run at at a high 20~30 fps (max setting), but good luck getting it to work at the optimized state. It reboots itself CONSTANTLY when I'm viewing it remotely (yes I've read that you can reduce framerate but A) REALLY should I have to reduce the quality of what the advertised framerate is? and B) The remote app I use doesn't allow for framerate adjustment at the app/camera level). I initially returned the first one I purchased thinking it was defective because of the constant reboots, but nope after a bit more research it's a terrible product defect that the manufacturer is well aware of and hasn't fixed. Before you assume I haven't done my homework, yes I have the latest firmware, UI, etc. But it just really isn't a great product. I would recommend purchasing the FI9821W BUT then Foscam still wins because you purchase their more expensive product. Anyway you cut this, don't purchase the FI8910W.",27-01-2014

I bought a couple of these cameras so that our rescue director can keep an eye on the puppy building and the kennel room while she's working on her computer, arranging adoptions.  It gives her peace of mind to be able to watch over the dogs during off-hours.  For $65 with Amazon Prime free shipping, this was something that I could afford to buy as a donation and the rescue is making excellent use of them.<br /><br />I installed \\""IP Camera Viewer 2\\"" on her Mac, from the Mac App Store - and \\""Foscam Viewer\\"" on her iPad.  Both apps were free and work great (although the Mac app doesn't support audio from this camera, it's still a great free app).<br /><br />I did review the lengthy negative app regarding issues some users have had with the camera.  I take reports like this with a grain of salt - First, it's an inexpensive camera - I don't expect MILSPEC hardware, and I'm willing to make a gamble at this price, as compared to other IP cameras that cost a LOT more.  Second, working in the customer support industry I know a lot of minor issues can get blown WAY out of proportion by a small group of vocal on-line users.  Third, I am comfortable & confident with Amazon's return policy.<br /><br />I've had zero problems with the cameras, working great for a week so far but I'll update the review if I find any significant issues.",27-01-2014

As others have said, it is not a 1-2-3 set up.  But I weighed my options of going for the $199 Dropcam, which I bought my daughter and hers was easy to setup or saving $130 and going for the Foscam.  Since I needed three of them, I figured I would save $390 and besides, I like learning new things with tech so I decided to go for this one.    Some differences of Drop Cam and Foscam.  1. Drop Cam easy to set up vs. Foscam - let's just say its challenging  2. Drop Cam is smaller and does not rotate - Foscam not only rotates around the whole room but when you access the camera from  your iPhone, just by touching the video and swiping your finger you can move the camera remotely.  3. Drop Cam is set up from their website.  My daughter just popped the CD in and it took her directly to the website to finish setting up her cameras.  - Foscam runs off a CD.  Now this is where some information would help for those who are trying to set this camera up.    Setup -  The setup instructions say to plug the camera in power then the router.  Did this but had trouble opening the exe file and having it pick up the camera. Once it finally did pick up the camera it shows you the IP address of your camera. ex: HTTP://192.168.1.25 and then I sat there wondering what to do since the setup instructions shows a picture of an interface popping open.  This did not happen.  Called Foscam and was told my wait was 25 minutes.  While waiting I figured I would try to type this address into a browser.  At first it only worked in I.E but then I got it opened in Firefox.  Once in there you can change the camera name and your password.  Then I was told to change ports so there is no conflicts.  Now I am working on the alerts.  When I go to set up the Alerts and click on the choice to have motion detection and press submit , I come up with \\""400 Bad Request Can't parse request\\""  I am still working on this problem and will update this review when I figure out what that problem is.    Now let's look at the software.  You will have to update the firmware first then the software second.  I am using an iPhone 4 and an iPad 2 for the software.  I downloaded both the free programs they have and both of them work fine on the iPhone but not so consistent on the iPad. I have iOS 6.1.3 on both.  Not sure if it's because I have little room left on the iPad and more on the iPhone but there is more inconsistency on the iPad. I will be upgrading to iOS 7 with more storage so I will update this review.    ------------------------------  Update 1/29/14    Called Foscam for support twice.  Both times the service was very professional and polite.  The first one, definitely from India was very hard to understand but he had the patience to stay with me an hour on the phone.  I allowed him to take control of my computer and he also could not get my camera to set the alarms.  He asked if he could do it from his computer and I gave him permission.  He was able to set the alarm from his computer so he said it was definitely something on my computer.  So then I had to get the other cameras programmed to send me email alerts and after disabling all my antivirus software and K-9 patrol, it still didn't work.  Then found out that in order to set the alarms, you have to click on the \\""Schedule\\"" and then click on \\""set All\\"" then it worked.  So I am not sure if it was a combination of things or if just this one thing made the difference.    I had updated my firmware and software but this support person said they just release another update a couple days ago.  This seemed to make a difference.  I was able to use the ipCamera.exe file then click on the camera's IP address and the browser did open.    I noticed that other posters stated that the support person makes you sign onto Amazon to rate them.  Well, this is how they work.  After you get done with the problem the support person must be instructed to ask where you bought the camera.  If you say Amazon and they are still in control of your PC, they literally try to sign onto Amazon for you and lead you through the process. I notice he went directly to my browser and typed in Amazon then attempted to go to the review site.  Since I do not have Amazon sign on automatically he asked me to sign on.  I politely and firmly told him that I would do it when I had time.  So saying all that, and without any pressure from any support person, I would still give this camera a 4-star rating for both the camera and the support they gave me.    The second camera couldn't be seen on my network so I called Foscam support and it took him about 5 minutes to figure out what was wrong.  Wait time was not as long as I had feared.  Embarrassingly, I typed in the wrong password to my router.  Of course, I thought it was right but I must have left something out.  This is just a note in case someone else doesn't see their camera on the network and they think that the password is correct.    The third camera wouldn't even start.  Again the support person took control of my PC and attempted to get the camera going by restarting and resetting it.  Nothing happened.  He immediately said to return the camera and they would replace it.  So I am working on that now. BTW, this one asked to rate them on Amazon and I told him I would do it later and he just let it go.  Never tried to sign onto Amazon for me.    Foscam gives clear pics in the dark and clear pictures in the light.  I love being able to remotely move the camera around from my phone and I would recommend this camera.  I think that Foscam must have read the reviews and are making great strides in trying to upgrade consumers experiences.  _________________  Update 1/30/14    One camera was defective.  I had a choice to return it direct to Foscam but I would have to pay the shipping since I did not purchase it from their site or return it to Amazon.  I am returning it and asking for a replacement because I am very pleased with the other two camera's.Just a note on the software:  I found the free Foscam software to work just fine with my camera's.  There was a suggestion to try the Foscam Blue Iris Pro.  If you want to try that software you can download a trial version off CNet. [...].",27-01-2014

My cats have been doing a whole lot of things they shouldn't be, and I was hoping to do a little sleuthing to suss out the culprit(s). This did not turn out to be the camera for the job.<br /><br />On the positive side, the build quality seems good, at least externally. Unpacking and setup was reasonably straightforward, and within half an hour I had established a WiFi connection to the camera and was viewing images. The image quality is excellent, even using the night vision. I had no doubt that if I could catch one of my felines in the act, I'd have no trouble discerning which one it was.<br /><br />For a few hours, things went well. I was using a freeware program to record snippets of video whenever the camera detected motion. However, I noticed about 6 hours in that the recordings had stopped. On troubleshooting, I discovered that the camera was no longer on my WiFi network.<br /><br />Figuring that maybe it was too far from the router (although it was only about 20' away, max), I repositioned the camera just on the other side of a wall from the router. The total distance was less than 5', with only one thickness of wall between them. Even at this distance, the camera dropped off the network again after 3 hours. The only way I could revive it was to power-cycle it. After three days of this, it's gotten to where it will only connect intermittently, even after doing the unplug/plug shuffle.<br /><br />Either there's a problem with the antenna or the internals.

I'm not done and haven't returned it but will continue this review when I do.  Right now I wouldn't recommend it.  Good things are that there is a wall mount which I love but looks like you need a plug nearby.  Its not rechargeable.  Ony 1 star right now.<br />02/25/2014-I'm still trying to get this to work.  It works inside of my network but not accessible currently from the outside which is the purpose of me originally buying it.  I have some computer knowledge although not much on installing networked cameras.  The 24/7 tech support they claim to have is very difficult to get ahold of.  When you do, you are treated like YOU are a tech person instead of understanding they need to walk you through what they describe.  Also most of the techs have very strong accents which are very hard to understand.  I also tried to email tech support and they DO NOT answer emails.  I have received more help from DP on these comments than I have received from them at all.<br />03/28/2014-After a long period of time, the camera is finally set up.  Its definitely NOT user friendly and for those that know nothing about computers, leave it up to someone else on this camera or buy another.

This camera is not for the technology averse. Do not buy this if you don't know what Port Forwarding/DDNS/WAN/LAN/etc are.<br /><br />I have no doubt there is an issue with these cameras involving sensor overload. I have also not experienced these issues with my setup. They are not pointed outside, or at a window. These are installed in interior rooms as baby monitors and work great for that purpose. I've got two of these cameras for $130 total and use smartphones with a 3rd party app to access them. Similar cameras marketed as &#34;Baby Monitors&#34; will run you at least $200 for one camera and a handheld unit.<br /><br />Many of these reviews are likely bogus/incentivized, especially the ones who talk about people like &#34;Irish&#34; etc. from Foscam using remote access to setup everything.<br /><br />These are not HD cameras. The picture in a lighted room is pretty good, night vision can get a little blurry, but still does the job. Pan/Tilt work really well on LAN, can be a laggy on WAN, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />Bottom line, I'm happy with what I have for the money.",21-01-2014

Since I didn't, I ended up rediscovering that the camera reboots--or shows blank video--periodically. Thinking it was a defective unit, I return the first one and got a replacement. Same problem. I spent an hour or more with tech support--and read Mr. Reberry's comments while on hold. These cameras are very limited in what they will tolerate. I let Foscam tech support control mine remotely, and they confirmed that the scene from the window was too detailed for the camera, so it failed. Their solution was to reset the image size to that of a large postage stamp, and slow the pan and zoom controls. This &#34;solution'' was entirely worthless to me--I couldn't see what was being monitored. They recommended that I upgrade to the FI8919W, but I see the Mr. Reberry says it probably has the same problem. I'm going to look for a different brand.

I am waiting on the the other parts to complete the project but in the mean time I set this up in my office.  The camera works great. I can access the camera from my computer, iPad, or Samsung S4 using various free apps.  It was easy to set up the DDNS service to be able to access the camera from outside my network. The only downside is that with the small antenna it often loses connection unless it is in my office where my router is located. I plan on investing in a wifi extender so I can set this up on a different floor of my house.  I would definitely recommend this one.",14-01-2014

For inside the home viewing while your phone or tablet is connected to your wireless network (as a baby monitor for example) it is a piece of cake! It isn't 100% plug and play for viewing while you are outside of your wireless network, but it is definitely doable so read more below.<br /><br />Why I bought it: I bought this camera as a supplement to my home alarm system. Essentially, if I get a call from the alarm company, I'd like the ability to pull up my cameras and see if anything looks out of place or God forbid, someone is in the home. I am currently using it to check in on a dog we are fostering for a local rescue! I have also used to to check our basement for any leaks/signs of water during very cold temperatures. The possibilities are endless. I am receiving another one from Amazon today.<br /><br />The good: $65-ish camera that has pretty good image quality, night vision, and can be viewed from almost anywhere. Free (or cheap) apps allow you to check in on your home or child with relative ease. The mount that comes with it is not bad at all and no other components are required for a basic installation.<br /><br />The not-as-good: I'm a fairly tech-savvy guy, but my weakness is network settings, router configuration and port forwarding. That is required to set up this camera for viewing it from outside your wireless network. Now, do not let that discourage you, because there are some great youtube videos by Foscam themselves and a guy that goes by AwkwardHamster on how to do this. Also, buying from Amazon you have tech support from Foscam if you need it.<br /><br />Overall, great camera so far. I've had it since Christmas and use it multiple times per day. I plan to continue to add more cameras.",13-01-2014

Unti seems to lose internet connection and/or reboot often, it then goes into search mode.  This issue is pointed out in a lot of the reviews.  The search mode &#34;wandering&#34; can be overcome by setting a position on start up, but that brings up the next issue.<br /><br />2)  Night vision.  There is now way to turn off night vision permanently.  You can turn it off, but the default is set to &#34;on&#34; when the unit reboots, which is often.  Why is this an issue?  I used the camera for keeping an eye on the yard via an inside window - so the night vision coming on would create a glare and render the unit useless.  Emails to support (which were responded to quickly) revealed that they can't fix this issue, so beware if you have thoughts of using it to monitor your yard via a window at night.<br /><br />3)  Bad JPEGs.  Unit is now creating pictures that are unreadable on my mac and iPhone.  This happens about 20% of the time.<br /><br />I wish the unit worked for me, but unfortunately I cannot recommend it.",12-01-2014

Feel like it is more for fun or casual use. I can't really count it as a security camera.<br /><br />Things I like:<br />1) Does what a very basic security camera does, including remote access, motion trigger, email/ftp upload;<br />2) Cheap<br /><br />Things I dislike:<br />1) ~20% of the time, it generates unreadable jpeg.<br />2) Not very reliable motion alarm. I set the sensitivity pretty high, but still it loses some frames during the motion (by loses I mean the captured images are supposed to be emailed or uploaded)<br />3) The image quality/resolution is too low (I know this is not specific for this camera), it only captures 640x480, You can't really use a 640x480 image to tell anything. Today even the cheapest phone takes better picture than that;<br />4) Some settings are not preserved after reboot. Each time after reboot, I have to manually re-adjust its angle, lights etc.<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for a security camera, move on, look for something better.<br /><br />UPDATE: after a few more weeks of using, I decided to further downgrade it to 1 star.",12-01-2014

FOSCAM claims that they have a DNS server built into this cam. What they don't tell you is that it does not actually activate till 2016. What kind of weirdness is that? Tenvis has a a built in DNS that works out of the box when you port-forward. Which you have to do for any IP Cam you wish to access outside of your home for those that don't know what a port-forward is.<br /><br />To be sure I was getting the better device I order 2 of this Foscam Wireless Cams Foscam FI8910W Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with Two-Way Audio and 1 TENVIS JPT3815W Wireless IP Pan/Tilt/ Night Vision Internet Surveillance Camera Built-in Microphone With Phone remote monitoring as well. I can tell you from real-world experience, you want to go with the Tenvis one.<br /><br />Yes the manual looks better on the Foscam but my God it is a lot easier to setup the Tenvis than this Foscam. I bought these to place outdoors in a Foscam outdoor dome and I could barely connect to either FOSCAM cams. Tenvis connects all the time, changing or setting up WIFI on the Tenvis in the advanced view is &#34;Simple Stupid&#34; if you have a laptop or phone and you have connected to wifi you will know what to do it with the Tenvis. It's is called an IP CAM for a reason. Most people buying want the option to view these cams remotely or at the very least set them up on their WIFI network with ease.<br /><br />The Tenvis has a better UI - User Interface for actually viewing the cam than the FOSCAM, once again simple stupid. People that buy loads of IP Cams do not need bloatware or GIGs of software just to access their cam FOSCAM ships a big CD with loads of software but that does not justify the price and the crappy device.<br /><br />Initialization: When you send power to a device and the time it takes that device to power-up and be ready for action. FOSCAM slow, one of the 2 FOSCAM cams I got took sometimes over 5 mins just to get discovered on the network after it's rotations<br /><br />As far as specs go. They are identical in terms of features Tenvis more so with the actual working DNS server that lets you view your cam from outside your network without paying for a third-party DNS.<br /><br />I am ending this review with this, I am actually returning both FOSCAM cams and getting 4 Tenvis cameras for my house. At $20 cheaper per unit as well.<br /><br />I hope my review helps whoever reading make the right decision on these FOSCAM cams. They are pretty crappy compared to their competition.<br /><br />Cheers...",11-01-2014

He uses his iphone and ipad to check in on them.  I thought this was a genius idea, so I bought one to try out.

The smartphone app lets you control (pan/tilt) the camera, turn the infrared lights on/off and even listen and speak through a two-way microphone.

Well, if you have a 14 year old son, nephew, neighbor etc, that can follow step by step instructions for port mapping, you will realize it is an awesome product. Obviously, you have to have a dedicated computer, tablet, or phone, to run an application that will capture video, as this product doesn't have a hard, drive. Dvr, or sd card. People that have written bad reviews probably didn't know that this is like a tv with no TiVo, u can watch all you want, but the camera needs something to store the data. They do offer a newer model with sd, but for the price, might as well use an old laptop with an upgraded hard drive. Discard the disc, download the latest software from foscam.us, keeping in mind that this only modifies the network, and so on data on the camera itself, and they offer a very basic web app that allows you to view and control some features. But you can get software or apps that have way more options like speed it up (about 4 times faster).

I am now aware how inferior my tech knowledge is after trying to make these cameras work for a few hours last night.<br /><br />Here is a rundown of the basics.<br /><br />2x FOSCAM FI8910W cameras<br />Verizon FIOS home internet, wireless<br />Mac OSX Mavericks<br />iOS7 - iPhones and iPads<br /><br />I purchased the cameras via Amazon.com from Warehouse Deals, Inc. and they were listed as refurbished (so used but back to new). One of the cameras did not come with any instructions or the software CD - bad customer service on the part of Warehouse Deals, Inc?<br /><br />Last night we tried to set up the camera using the iPhone app. That did not work so we plugged the cameras into the router and tried to connect that way. We both have new mac laptops so we no longer have a CD Drive in our house so we could not run the software from the CD included in the camera boxes. I tried downloaded the IP Camera software from the FOSCAM site and it was able to pick up the &#34;Anonymous&#34; camera on the network and take me to the IP page to start ActiveX. Once I clicked on ActiveX, though, I could never get the &#34;Device Management&#34; portion to work (I would click on it and nothing would happen; &#34;Javascript:administrator()&#34; would appear in the lower left of the browser window. I used Chrome, Firefox, and Safari and had the same results for all three. Cookies are enabled in all of the browsers. Internet Explorer is no longer supported by Apple so that is not an option for us.<br /><br />After these tries, we went back to the iPhone app. The app would sporadically 'find' the camera but settings could never be updated. It would drop the camera then find it again. And we would get an error notification that the user name and password were not correct OR we exceeded the number of devices on our network. We checked the devices on our network and that was not the problem.<br /><br />We gave up in frustration at 1am last night having made NO progress or having any luck at all in making the cameras work. The cameras would cycle through its motions but we never got a picture from it in any way.<br /><br />This morning we discovered through the iPhone app that each camera has an odd user name that we did not set up. Now we are curious if this means that our refurbished items were never restored to factory default and we don't have the old user name/password so we can't login because of that...?<br /><br />For the price and capabilities, we want to keep these cameras and get them set up...I just need some help from the interwebs to step me through the process like I've never touched a computer before.<br /><br />Thanks!",06-01-2014

I previously used a very similar Trendnet camera for several years.  Before that a Panasonic.  I mount them outside (against instructions, of course) in the heat (Phoenix) but under the patio roof.  The extreme temps may shorten the cameras' lives but they work fine for years.<br />The Foscam's color is better than the Trendnet so now my backyard tree leaves look green in sunlight, rather than gray.  Still gray, of course, in infrared light. The infrared illumination and imaging works very well on this camera. The mounting hardware is improved. But putting the &#34;working&#34; light on the back of the camera makes it useless once the camera is installed overhead.<br />I use the free Foscam domain address for internet access and that has been trouble-free.  Now that I have a smart phone I particularly enjoy the ability to check on my house anytime, anywhere.  I have the camera send me regular photos via email.

I have to investigate that further.<br />I really like this camera but advise anyone who isn't knowledgeable about wireless setups (IPs, etc.) that you may need help with installation.

No idea at all why that mattered, but it did help.<br />-Dangerous to set up port forwarding to the camera as passwords are sent in plaintext.  I didn't do so for this reason, which means I can only watch a live video feed when I'm already in my house.<br />-Needs to be rebooted once every 1-2 months, then the pan/tilt needs to be reset manually using the software.<br />-The automatically uploaded pictures to an FTP site is a great idea, but I'd have like to had seen a way to set it to automatically delete pictures older than X days or something like that.  I had to delve into the world of cron jobs to set up a job to do this for me so my FTP site doesn't fill up.<br />-There's no real happy-medium for the motion sensing sensitivity.  If i have it on a 7, it doesn't sense me walking by until too late.  If I have it on a 8, I get 100s of pictures with no one in them on my FTP.  So, I'm stuck with the 100s of pictures with no one in them.<br />-Motion-detected pictures cannot be cached on the camera.  What this means is that I cannot set the camera to take pictures after motion is detected more than once a second, as the first picture has to be fully uploaded to the FTP site before the next picture can be taken.  I think it fully logs out/in to the FTP with every picture upload, so it can take a full second for the full process to occur.  This means walking towards the camera for about 20', then around a bend and up my stairs results in a single picture of me walking towards the camera (albeit only about 50% of the time due to motion sensitivity issues), one of me making the turn, and one of my back as I walk up the stairs.<br />-The picture quality is not good when used as described above.  I'd liken it to the stereotypical picture of bigfoot.  If I stand there and stare at the camera it's a good picture.  When moving around as any intruder would, the motion blur is horrible, even with the &#34;motion compensation&#34; setting turned on.<br />-Cannot do motion-sensed videos and then upload them.<br /><br />So, considering those cons, this camera just isn't very useful as a security camera.  I'd estimate if a burglar came into my house, I'd have a 50/50 shot of getting a picture at all of the front of them as they walk up/down the stairs.  Even then, I'd give it another 50/50 shot that the picture would be clear enough to be at all useful in apprehending them.<br /><br />I'm most likely going to buy a Dropcam HD and pay the $99 annual fee to record everything in HD.  This will solve all of these issues.",30-12-2013

In response to all of the reviews stating the set up difficulty, do not worry!!!! When you buy from a Foscam authorized dealer, you get free support. I called and the customer service rep Andrew was most helpful, remoted into my PC and within 1/2 hour I was connected, had wifi working and was able to view on my phone and tablet!!! The support offered was wonderful and I took full advantage of it.<br />Camera picture quality is about what I expected, good not great. Very easy to pan and see an entire room. The buttons are very self explanatory for operating the camera on your pc or tablet. I am pleased with my purchase and if the only thing holding you back from buying is the fear of set up, don't worry....just call the tech support and they will do it for you!!!!

You can set them up to send pictures of what's going on to your email or an FTP server. Since they have motion detection, you will only receive them when something moves on screen.<br /><br />I'd like to comment on an annoying little problem with this feature though. The motion detection is very, very sensitive. Even moving light across the screen, like when a cloud passes by, triggers the motion detection, so if you have it set up for email, you will be swamped with these emails in no time.<br /><br />I set it up to send pics to an ftp folder on a Raspberry pi, there are methods to record video/audio using one but I haven't had time to fiddle with that yet.<br /><br />There are Android apps and I'm assuming iOS apps as well, which you can use to see and move the cameras remotely. They have support for dynamic dns services like no-ip, so make sure to read a little about that and basic networking before diving head first into setting up these cameras for remote access.",27-12-2013

It took 5 minutes to do and I've not had any problems since. I can check the house at work or on vacation...any time day or night and I don't have to pay a monthly monitoring service.

I got one from Amazon and the other directly from Foxcam (they had a sweet one day deal).  I'm pretty savvy with the technical network stuff and had no problems.  I made of couple of simple mistakes along the way during setup, but figured out where I went wrong pretty quickly.  I found the written instructions (read them after I had everything working) were very clear and would be useful to someone without much technical skill.<br /><br />I set my camera up for remote monitoring.  To do so you do need to be ready to log into your home router and make some configuration additions (1) create static IP's and (2) assign port numbers to those IP's.  Remote monitoring works surprisingly well.  I hard wired one camera directly to my router, its too far from the wireless router to get a consisten signal.  The second camera I connected wirelessly.  There are no performance differences.  If you have a good enough wireless signal, that's the way to go.<br /><br />The camera image is clear and the colors seem reasonably accurate.  One camera is mounted inside monitoring the inside, the other under a large eave monitoring the outside.  The eave is big enough that the camera won't get wet.  So far its working fine even though its and inside camera.<br /><br />I did experience the famous buffer overflow / endless reboot problem.  My outside camera is aimed at trees with high detail.  Its the high detail that blows up the camera.  I contacted Foxcam and they now have a software fix.  Foxcam RMA's my camera and within less than two weeks I had the camera back and now it works perfectly.  Problem solved.  I recommend the camera's for simple monitoring.",27-12-2013

The customer service was great... an no, I'm not paid by foscam to do this review.  I live in Denver and have left plenty of reviews for random crap throughout my time on Amazon.  So, back to the camera.  This is an indoor only camera.  Do not try and use it outside, unless it's a completely shaded area.  Mine would black out when in the direct sunlight; however, it works fine in the front yard, where its shaded throughout the day.  The audio works good, but not great.  I can watch my wife grill, and make annoying sounds at her while she does it. :)  She's beginning to hate the cameras.  The reason it only works good, instead of great, is due to the sound echoing over and over again after you say something, unless you turn off the sound.  Basically, the camera hears itself, and plays what it hears.  But for pete's sake, it's a camera, not a surveillance device.... or maybe it is a surveillance device....  eh....  It is rather fun to listen to people at your front door when ever you don't answer.<br /><br />The PTZ works well.  you can make it go fast, or slow.  Just play with it until you find the right method.<br /><br />  I ordered a outdoor, stationary camera for the backyard, so it will work in the sunlight. I'll leave a review for that, once it comes in.<br /><br />SOOOOOO  in short, call customer service and have them hook up the camera so you can connect over the internet.  I did it after I hooked it up over the wi-fi, which was easy to do with the CD provided and tutorial.  Call customer service, and you'll love these camera's.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />The camera's have a known flaw inthem, and MUST be sent in to get it replaced.  If the wrong light hits the camera, or it's just bright where the camera points at, the camera resets, and continues to do so.  It constantly resets.  Once you send them in, they work fine; however, you have to pay for shipping and a fee when you send them in. Sigh.  They have an \\""auto pay,\\"" button for the fee/shipping cost.  almost set up like a scam.  Just saying.",20-12-2013

Was not able to setup on a MAC at all so I used a PC. Non of the MAC tools worked. I wanted a 'true outdoor' camera but these are not truly outdoor. I have to keep them inside on a side table by the windows and therefore my view is limited. In this type of use, they keep adjusting themselves with the outdoor light changes and I have to keep readjusting the lenses. What this means is that when the light changes outside, it takes motion photos because it detects light changes and shadows. Then, it goes back to where the light source is and takes photos of the sky instead of remaining where I want it. I work with computers (for a living) and understand networking, ports, etc. so for someone with little or no knowledge, they should get something more user-friendly or get help from a friend. I am going to try to get some more advance setting to adjust the timing on photos and also see if I can finally get a free dns name so I can get a true remote view.

This is my 3rd camera from this company. I highly suggest these cameras over buying the $200+ baby monitoring systems seen in stores. My only suggestion, mount the camera if it's going to be anywhere near the baby crib. The first camera (FI8918W) I bought two years was casually placed on the corner of the crib to watch my baby. Over the last two years my baby has knocked the camera down numerous times. It still functions, but the speaker and video don't work anywhere near as good as it did new (picture is fuzzy/grainy and you can't hear the speaker unless you stick it in your ear). I relegated the slightly dysfunctional camera to the dog room and bought two new cameras (one for current baby and one for baby on the way). New camera is mounted to the wall above the crib and does a perfect job while being safely out of reach from baby.",04-12-2013
US,50032907,R3SAIMUUL1OQYC,Foscam FI8910W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with IR-Cut Filter for True Color Images - 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67° Viewing Angle) NEWEST MODEL,Camera,1,1,2,N,Y,"Good attempt, but not functional due to networking issues.","Good attempt, but not functional due to networking issues.<br />I have mixed feelings about this camera, but after the latest firmware upgrade, I'm about to give up on Foscam.<br /><br />One recurring issue that I've been patiently putting up with is slow response of its Web interface.  It takes half a minute for the interface to respond.  Pressing camera Pan and Tilt (PT) arrows have no effect on the camera until you press up, down, left or right few times, then the camera moves too far, you have to press the opposite arrow few times to get it to move, then again, it moves passed the point where you want it to be pointing.<br /><br />Second disappointment is the image quality.  You could see general contours of people and objects, but the detail is somewhat grainy.  Perhaps quality image is not something that should be expected from a sub $100 camera.<br /><br />Third disappointment is that audio only works in Internet Explorer (IE) and only if you install a Foscam ActiveX control.  My position is that I'm not installing ActiveX controls, which have full access to my computer from a Chinese company that I absolutely do not trust to have any control over my computer.  So, this means no audio for me.<br /><br />Fourth issue that makes this camera simply unusable, at least in my settings is the networking.  Wired network that should be rock solid stops working every 1 to 2 days and requires the Ethernet cable to be removed and plugged back in before video stream resumes.  The WIFI doesn't have this problem, at least when the camera is close to the WIFI router, so one camera that is inches from the wireless router and within a cable reach of an Ethernet switch is using WIFI.  However, the camera that is 50 feet away, where I do need wireless connection, acts bipolar when it comes to maintaining that connection.  First, it doesn't connect to the WIFI router, unless I connect a PC using Ethernet cable, immediately select \\""scan\\"" for WIFI, re-select my WIFI SSID and select\\""apply\\"".  Only then it would connect and stay connected.  However, if I change any settings remotely, then \\""apply\\"" them, the camera reboots and doesn't reconnect to WIFI.  This requires me to repeat the laptop kabuki dance.  The final straw was the latest firmware update (11.37.2.54), the further (50 ft away) camera refuses to connect to WIFI at all.  When I select \\""scan\\"" in the Wireless LAN Settings, my network is visible, but selecting it and applying that selection doesn't result in the camera actually connecting.  If I bring the camera physically to be next to the WIFI router, it works fine.  One more data point is that my iPhone displays full WIFI signal strength next to the distant camera, never has an issue sending or receiving data with its internal WIFI antenna, so it is clearly not the signal strength issue.  While the Foscam camera with upgraded 9Db antenna that is about 10 inches long, doesn't work.<br /><br />In conclusion, this camera is a good idea in a good looking package, but either the electronics inside or the firmware makes this camera unusable until at least the networking issues are addressed.",04-12-2013

Apparently 10.6 versions or later are not compatible with the plugin needed for the audio. Unfortunately I only learned this after paying a tech to setup the camera (over 2 hours which I paid for after investing 2 hours of my own time setting it up as directed and it failing to work wirelessly). The video comes through but isn't high quality.<br /><br />When viewed on an iphone, audio apparently isn't an option. It's impossible to hit the correct arrow consistently to pan the camera in the desired direction. If you zoom in on the controls, you then can't see much of the video.

No other camera in this price range with same feature set!,"I was very nervous about buying this after poring over the reviews. Many have warned about Foscam being a shady company, Many warned that their BBB complaints were very high. There also seems to be a lot of people that complain about the wifi.<br /><br />The BBB complaints seems to be true. The Company doesn't appear to work with anyone, again, based on the number of BBB complaints. As far as the wifi goes, well I can't speak to that because i've never used it.<br /><br />What I can tell you is I have loved this network camera! I've only used it with a hardline network connection. With this type of connection I've yet to have any problems connecting to it. The picture quality is decent, if you're expecting HD you'll be disappointed. The Audio quality isn't great but gets me by just fine. I'm using this as a baby monitor, and it lets me know when he crys!<br /><br />The Foscam android app SUCKS. If you're looking for a good Android/ Apple app, Check out &#34;IP Cam Viewer&#34;. It's been on android longer than apple, its more mature for those android devices.<br /><br />I am an engineer by trade, so i consider myself tech savvy. Saying setup was a piece of cake is unfair, it's all relative. However, if you're unable to get it setup, don't give it a bad review. It doesn't mean its a bad product, it most likely means you're incapable of the task. Everyone knows someone who is technically inclined, give them a call.<br /><br />For the money you can not beat the feature set this camera gives you. If wifi is your only option, my review may be of no use to you. BUT, if you have the ability to run a network cable to it, do it!<br /><br />As far a con's go, it has a built in speaker that allows you to send audio to the unit.

If I could give it no stars, I would. Unfortunately too, I waited too long to return it, and now I am stuck. Despite having upgraded the firmware and the web UI software, the camera still has a mind of its own. Sometimes I can access the web UI, and sometimes it says that the web page cannot be displayed, despite being on the same LAN and trying from at least three different connected devices. I am an IT professional, and I have take all the normal troubleshooting steps. The camera goes on and off on its own, and it randomly scans the horizon even though I set it not to. The problem is definitely with the camera itself. I have tried from multiple browsers, from multiple OS', and using multiple technologies (e.g. activeX, server push, etc). Furthermore, on multiple occasions, trying to view the camera display in IE on my Win7 machine using ActiveX, the entire compute froze up, not just the web page, but the entire computer. I had to reboot and lost any unsaved work. These problems reflect poor programming and poor QC on the part of Foscam. If you want something reliable, I suggest another manufacturer. I only review things I get if they are really great or really bad, and this thing sucks, by far the most disappointing purchase I made from Amazon.

One of the died within the first month and I bought another to replace it. Configuring these units reminds me of the early days of laser printers (when one had to install software and hardware fonts) or the early scanners (with horrible OCR results) - these are not ready for prime time. Lots of glitches, lots of steps, lots of things to do when there are problems. In short, these are not for the squeamish or for anyone looking for a simple and fast and reasonable monitoring solution.<br /><br />Of the three cameras now in my lineup, two are transmitting video, but cannot be rebooted. One is not recognized by the wireless router and is off line. In other words, all three cameras have issues which I have not been able to resolve. Rather than throwing more money and time down this rat hole, I think I will wait for the market to mature and better devices to be introduced.",24-11-2013

It gives a good image and the pan and tilt work well. It is when I tried to set it up wirelessly that I ran into big problems and could not set it up so that the computer would recognize it; so, it sits on a shelf until I have time to go back and try to set it up again, using one of the older reviews here on Amazon that seems to be well written and warns not to install the software.<br /><br />If I get it running properly I will update my review.

US,14304235,R1AWAYBZLSRAIB,Foscam FI8910W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with IR-Cut Filter for True Color Images - 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67° Viewing Angle) NEWEST MODEL,Camera,3,0,0,N,Y,I would say its just OK...so far.,"My experience with this camera has been generally good...so far.<br /><br />I originally bought it as a possible front door camera for my 80+ year old mother but set it up at my home first to see how it might work for her. I liked the idea that it has 2-way audio available, could be remotely aimed and being wireless might be an easy install.<br /><br />Setup was fairly easy and I found it worked on Windows, Android, and Apple products with suitable apps.  The integrated IR LEDs are bright enough to illuminate maybe 50-75' out from the camera when its dark.<br /><br />I pretty quickly decided that this should probably not be used outdoors unless extremely well protected from the elements so I ordered a Foscam dome enclosure for it.  One of the first problems I encountered when going into the dome with this is the IR LEDS light up the inside of the dome and wash out the field of view completely when they are on.  So I put black electrical tape over them, not wanting to do any mods like disabling them that might void the warranty.  I then needed an external IR illuminator and assumed that because I can see a small amount of visible red from the installed LEDs they were probably 850nm.  However I didnt want to buy anything until I could conform that 850 was the right choice and ther seemed to be some disagreement on forums about what was best.  So I bought a small sample of clear encased T 1/3/4 &#34;100ma&#34; 850nm, 890nm and 950nm IR LEDS, all rated at about the same luminosity on axis at 100ma and with roughly the same directional characteristics.  I set up a test board with one of each mounted and biased each to operate at the same luminous output as the others based on the published current versus luminosity.  I was easily able to see thru the camera that the 850nm was the best choice as it produced about twice the brightness of the 890 and that twice the 950 with this camera when it was in &#34;IR On&#34; mode. It was dark otherwise.  Side note - the 850 LED doesproduce a slight visible red glow where the 890 and 950 do not.  This is not a mystery, its just a characteristic of LEDs. They produce a primary wavelength light and bell shaped sidebands of longer and shorter and longer wavelength light.  It happens the only output we can actually see from any of these is the red which is on the shorter wavelength sideband of the 850 LED.  I bought an inexpensive 850nm illuminator to mount outside the dome and that works great.<br /><br />Now to my main criticism and the main reason I decided to not install this for my mother to use at her house.  The wireless connection (802.11 G)  is just too slow making the operation of the camera pan and tilt very hit and miss.  Sometimes its immediate and sometimes its....never.  And it is usually somewhere in between.  Maybe 802.11  would be fact enough.  A wired LAN connection is much better, but whats the point in the extra costs of the built-in wifi if you have to wire it up. Anyway I just couldnt see my mother bothering to deal with that.<br /><br />Another weak spot is the sound from the internal speaker or an external speaker/amp plugged in to the camera.  I would guess that a lot gets dropped somewhere between the mic on the smartphone/tablet/desktop (I tried all and, with Android 4.2, Win8, and IOS) and the speaker (its likely at the camera) because it is mostly not understandable.  The other way - mic on the camera to all the above is much better, at least its intelligible.<br /><br />So, I am hanging onto this unit and mounted at my front door in the dome. As it happens getting AC power there is easy but running a LAN cable nearly impossible.  My mother in going to get a fixed mount, no sound POE wired camera - at her house running a LAN is easy, getting AC power to it not so easy.",22-11-2013

My inner geek took over and I figured there must be other solutions out there that would meet my requirements and beyond. Compared to an equivalent Motorola or other brand video monitor this comes in about 2-3 times cheaper depending on fluctuating sale prices. Granted, the dedicated models usually come with no fuss set up and a dedicated viewer monitor. But with some elbow grease, this will do that and more like remote viewing via iphone/Android apps or any PC that's connected to the internet. It also has pan and tilt so you could effectively see 270 degrees horizontally around the camera. The camera tilts upwards too but has a limited angle downwards; probably because its own base would impede visibility. I've mounted two of them upside down to alleviate as the apps and pc settings allow you to invert the image as needed. I also liked the idea that these would see a repurposed life as security cams after the initial baby years.<br /><br />Video Quality<br />Max supported res is 640*480 and on my wireless N network I seem to get 10-15 fps at best. I'd consider this good enough to monitor the overall situation but you won't be seeing razor sharp detail nor fast movement; it's enough resolution and frame rate to smoothly capture someone walking across view. Night vision is excellent and I have no issues seeing over 10 feet in each room in total darkness. In other words, I can see clearly if baby is stirring, awake, and of course actively looking for us.<br /><br />Audio Quality<br />These camera's offer 2 way audio and in practical terms that means it transmits audio from the room it's in and also plays back audio out of a speaker. Yes, it's like an intercom. The catch of course is that in order to talk through the camera, your pc must have a mic built in like many modern laptops already do or your Apple/Android device has to have a mic input too of course. There are mic and speaker input/outputs on the back but I've found that I don't need them as the mic sensitivity and speaker volume are fine for both our living room and nurseries.<br /><br />Setup<br />So decent video and audio, but what is it like to setup? The Foscam.us site has improved A LOT and now they have youtube tutorials to guide you through as much or as little setup as is needed for your use. I only went through initial camera setup, wifi network setup, but left motion alarms, FTP uploads, and other advanced features alone. I just wanted to be able to watch what's going on remotely. The first camera took close to 2 hours to set up as I clumsily jumped between googled guides I found, Foscam's website, and my own Wireless Router's port forwarding settings. The 2nd and 3rd camera's were set up as quickly as 20 min once I became familiar with the process steps needed for my use. The website or cd provides a utility to identify the camera's ip address so you can navigate to the camera's web interface via a webbrowser and configure from there. That's all you need if you just want to view video within your wifi network. Remote access will require you dig into your router to set up port forwarding, and a web host like no-ip.org becomes a desired feature so you can just type in a web address instead of your public ip address when remote. There are instructions how to do these things and none of them are hard it just takes time to follow along.<br /><br />Install<br />Camera comes with power cord, plastic wall mount, lan cable, and external antenna. The mount is serviceable and with the proper screws you can mount easily on drywall. Note that the camera unit is pretty big and not easy to hide or blend in decor. it's the size of the chunkiest early generation webcam you can imagine. The one advantage of dedicated units is that you could take them with you to other people's homes and since they are locked to a particular viewing monitor you'd be set up in minutes. These camera's rely on broadcasting their signal via wifi so unless you're up for redoing setup while travelling it's probably best to consider these as permanent installations at home.<br /><br />Apps<br />I view my camera's on both IOS and Android platforms. On android I use tinyCam Monitor PRO, to me it has the best layout on Android and is worth the $5 I spent on it. On Iphone, I use Foscam Pro which had the best mix of layout and functionality up until the latest update. Their app team is still trying to squash bugs but it's already on its way to become the top Foscam viewer app again. With these apps, I can remotely view and take video's and/or pictures that are saved to my mobile device.<br /><br />Alternatives?<br />If all this setup sounds daunting to you, I would suggest looking into Dropcam product offerings. They offer streamlined setup, better video quality, but no pan/tilt functionality and cost about 2x.",20-11-2013

With that simple change a frustrating couple of days became better ... hope it continues.<br /><br />I purchased this model to replace one of my Linksys WVC80N cameras that had become erratic.  The first camera I received would not \\""scan\\"" for available wireless networks so I returned the unit and ordered a second camera.  This is where Amazon shines ... simple returns and replacements.<br /><br />Although I'm no expert, I have set up 4 other wireless cameras so at least I have that experience.  I followed the instructions but was unable to get a reliable wireless connection.  By reliable I mean that I could occasionally get wireless connected but any changes, e.g. passwords, port, etc., requiring a reboot interrupted the wireless link and it could not be reestablished.  Resetting and going through the entire process again would sometimes result in a wireless link but it was fleeting.  I contacted Foscam support and they were able to establish a wireless connection via remote management of my PC.  As best I could determine they did nothing different from what I had been doing so I didn't have much hope that it would be reliable.  When I queried the tech about the probability of the connection remaining stable when I needed to adjust a setting or move (unplug) the camera, the tech responded that I could always call back.  I considered asking him to stay on the line while I relocated the camera but by that time I was about done with the tech and the camera.<br /><br />Of course when I moved the camera, I lost the wireless link.  While searching the postings on the various sites I thought I had read that the camera has an issue with the router channel being set to \\""auto\\"" ... lost the citation so I can't post it here.  But I gave it a try ... finding an unused channel in my area and voila the cameraconnected and has remained connected through changes and reboots.  I certainly don't know if I can make a valid assumption that this is cause and effect.  I may decide to go back and reset the router to \\""auto\\"" and see if I lose wireless ... but I'll give it a day or two.<br /><br />Way too many 5 star reviews by people with only 1 review ever posted ...<br /><br />As to performance: Image is better than my Linksys cameras, pan/tilt work fine, IR gives me usable image.

For the minimal cost, without any extra software or bells and whistles, it was easy to use and very functional.  The night vision works much better than expected, too.  Before I get into more minutia I'll just say that I would recommend this product.  For the price you can't beat it.<br /><br />The only major downsides were that:<br /><br />1) You will need to know how to port forward though your home firewall (you are using a home firewall right??) if you are wanting remote access.  The instructions looked like they would be useful to someone not familiar with this concept but I thought it was pretty straight forward.<br /><br />2) It doesn't support HTTPS (secure web) access.  This is a major outage and a feature that should be added to the camera without the need for more fancy management software.  In order to achieve this I experimented with an HTTPD reverse proxy setup on my home server as well as the use of Stunnel but both of these methods require a running computer in the home and some intermediate knowledge of such things.  It is not something I would even attempt to instruct my parents into doing for instance.  The HTTPD method did work fine but you will lose the 2-way audio capabilities (as the camera uses a different communication path to setup the audio channels.  I had mixed success with the stunnel method but some of that may have been the application I was using on my smartphone.  it did occasionally work though.  If you use camera management server software however I'm sure this problem is resolved for you.<br /><br />All that said several Android applications work great with the camera (directly to the camera or though the HTTPD reverse proxy and stunnel).  The motion sensors appear to function flawlessly and it's nice to be able to adjust the sensitivity.  I do wish they would have documented how long the cameras will FTP images once the motion sensor has been tripped though (about 40 seconds is what I've found), so the documentation could be a little more technically detailed.

There was a mid-cycle rev on the camera that is not apparent unless you read carefully, and both are available for sale on Amazon.

This reminds me of everything wrong with tech i.e. - printers fall under the same problems.  As soon as I saw a CD to install, I was disappointed. I kept hoping the product would prove me wrong.  After the CD 'install' (which is really only a link the IP address of the camera), it requires you to make a direct connection to the router to set it up which is laughable and sad.  THEN, it proceeds to use the browser as the only option to view!  I still haven't seen  the point of the CD…ugh.  I then configured and setup the wireless options but only to realize you need an outdated plugin (by the way plugins are outdated anyhow) for the browsers to hear any audio…again, also not on the CD.  I tried convincing myself that being able to control the camera from my computer was worth it and I'd grow to like it more but after staring at so-so resolution and realizing there wasn't free or official smartphone app, I gave up.  I'm returning it.  These companies are way behind the times of today's tech.  I definitely would not recommend this unless you have a need for a full security system and prefer these cameras to be all hard-wired (meaning connected directly to the ethernet cables) and you have no intention of using a smartphone to view.<br /><br />Though I'm aware it wasn't created in 2002, the software truly reminds me of tech from that time.

I wish there was a version for browsers.<br /><br />The only issue I've had is that from time-to-time it can't be accessed.  Some times a power down/power up will fix it and once I had to use some basic DOS commands from my Windows 8 computer to get it going.  Usually it will come back to life on its own but it's disconcerting if you're relying on the cam for remote viewing and you can't reach it.<br /><br />The mounting bracket give you lots of mounting options.  I didn't have any issues setting up the Cam with my router with Port Forwarding but I have better-than-usual computer skills.<br /><br />In all, even with the occasional dropouts, based on the price/performance ratio I give it 4 stars and may purchase more units in the future.",05-11-2013

I read the most helpful review about not installing the software but going by those steps I was only able to get the camera to work with plugged in Ethernet. I setup the port forwarding on my Apple Airport Extreme but the camera wouldn't recognize the network.<br /><br />I went to [...] and downloaded their IP Camera Tool. I configured it through that, rebooted, and now it works great!<br /><br />The camera quality is ok for remote viewing/monitoring. Night vision is good. The two-audio is practically useless, even plugged into Ethernet. It's distorted terribly and it has a big delay. Getting audio FROM the camera though works fairly well. Granted, I was using an iPhone app to communicate through the camera on an LTE connection so take that as you will. It could have just been a bandwidth issue.<br /><br />All and all, for less than $100, I couldn't ask for a better IP camera.

They all are awful and unreliable.  Two of the cameras are via a wired connection (one will only work at all this way, won't work on wireless - should).  The FI8904W (wired connection) will not stay live.  It is not a network problem.  It works for a few hours, sometimes an entire day, but always loses the picture.  Most times I can access the web setup, but no picture will show.  Sometimes, if I unplug and replug it it, it will start working, but who knows for how long.  Very annoying.  A surveillance camera isn't worth much if you can't see the image!  The other wired connection, FI8916W does pretty well when wired, but still often restarts and does it's panning thing.  Also, it is supposed to be wireless, but it will not pick up and hold the signal unless it is 2-3 feet from the source.  The other thing with all 3 Foscam cameras, is that they cannot take any brightness at all!!!  It will knock out the FI8904W completely and the FI8916W and FI8910W will keep restarting over and over and over again if it is sunny and bright outside.  Again, not much help from a surveillance camera.  The FI8910W has decided that level 4 on the brightness control is just too much for it.  The area it is viewing is shaded, but it still doesn't like level 4.  Now, it is working, but it is so dark, it is hard to see clearly what is going on.  I will never, ever, ever buy another Foscam camera again.  I should have heeded the warnings of previous review and posts.  I have 5 cheap no pan, no tilt, 930L DLink cameras that just sit there and work.  They may not have the highest resolution and you can't pan or tilt them, but they always work.

The product is unreliable and displays typical ignorance of its designers and programmers. It is difficult to start the connection, it requires hardwired connection and a special program just for that. Normal 21st century ways do not work. The entries in the programming menu are not written in standard english and not written with standard logic. They are better than in some other products from the far east - but still not comfortable.<br />Most Pan and Tilt cameras have the Center button - this one too - but it does not do centering - it sends the camera into a frenzy, the lengthy dance to all corners. Good if you want to test the camera, but not every single time. Changing settings, most of the time, forces camera re-boot which includes the lengthy dance too. You need a lot of time to program this thing. And after you think you are done -- the camera will do time-outs, i.e. loosing the picture with an error message: e.g. \\""Fail to connect to device:Disconnected by the device\\"" or similar. One camera displaying this behaviour died within 60 days, the other within 1 hour. The WiFi section must be from junk manufacturer.<br />This is occurring regardless of firmware version. The newest version xxxx54 does not fix the problems. I reported several firmware problems to Foscam months ago. Since then Foscam firmware was changed 3 times and nothing got corrected. It is now xxxx54 and still crappy.<br />Foscam technical support is unresponsive. Out of several problems reported only one time they had an answer for me - the camera comes with PRE-SET capability turned off by default - why? - for what reason?<br /> If you go on chat with support people - you will get connected to an agent who will not help you but will send your connection to another agent which usually will not pick-up the call before you run out of good will. Or you will get a really great advise - waste some more time and send us an email with problem description and receipt and maybe we will send you RMA, after which you may send us your camera and maybe we will send you a refurbished one that somebody else complained about, so now we will play lottery and maybe you will not notice the same problems that the other person did.<br />But it might be helpful to know that telephone agents can connect to your camera using Teamviewer and make changes in the camera setup if possible. This of course does not fix the WiFi hadrware problem.<br />When it works - the picture is rather good, but during the transitory day/night period the camera's infrared filter will loudly click repeatedly waking whoever does not need awaking, will alert anyone in vicinity and generally fail to stay silent. The Foscam official technical support reply is to turn off the night vision -- are they serious -- really?",31-10-2013

I can watch my kids through my phone and communicate back and forth with them when they're home.  That's cool.  The problem is that the motion sensing and emailing functions don't seem to work for me.  It will sense motion, and it will send email, but it sometimes sends emails when it detects motion, though it never attaches snapshots from the camera when it sends email (it's supposed to send 6 at a time).<br /><br />I've been in IT for 15 years so I'm pretty sure I'm doing it right.  Part of the problem is that the documentation is old and/or confusing.  For example, in the documentation online, it says Gmail, which I'm using as my email provider. won't work.

See discussion thread here: [...]<br /><br />I have an FI8918W which is the predecessor, and I like it a lot, but the image quality is terrible compared to the FI8910W. I like everything about this camera, but it isn't yet clear how to be sure you get one of the fixed ones. I am returning one today which I received last night, and I expect to return the second one I ordered last night. Unfortunately I also returned my 8918 thinking I'd swap it for an 8910 and now I'm not sure what to do.<br /><br />While I would prefer to buy from Amazon, I plan to contact Foscam directly to learn whether I can buy a fixed version as I intend to buy seven or eight of these.

I'd four-star this one without the DSP bug.<br /><br />Edit: Foscam support offered to pull four units and test them and flash them with the DSP fix before shipping to me.

These same people also said that you can not control the camera from an iPhone (on this point they are wrong). I have managed to get camera to be able to be controlled from the iPhone app, it took a bit of unorthodox thinking, but it can be done! It took me nearly two weeks to get the camera up and running on my network. You need the Foscam Pro + Audio APP for the iPhone (price $8.00). The people at the Foscam technical support have no knowledge on how to get the camera controlled from the aforementioned APP. Foscam Pro + Audio APP is a third party APP and not sanctioned by Foscam.

Works well, but. . . .",". . .you really need to know your way around your router and have a decent understanding of port forwarding.<br /><br />I have 4 of these cameras in use now and overall I'm pretty happy with them. I bought the first two when they cam up for sale on Woot a while back and added the 2-pack from Amazon a couple of weeks ago. I use them for home security and as \\""Kitten cams\\"" for the wife when she is away on business and suffering feline separation anxiety.<br /><br />Prior to getting the Foscams I was using a couple of Astek Moles. Comparing these the Foscams have a slightly wider field of view and their IR \\""night vision\\"" is head and shoulders above the Moles.<br /><br />These are indoor cameras and can not be used safely outdoors but I do have 2 mounted on windows viewing well lit areas outside the home and they work well under these conditions.<br /><br />The CONS:<br /><br />The built-in web interface sucks! The design is actually quite nice but the implementation leaves a great deal to be desired. The thing will give you various errors when attempting to make simple changes to the config, often requiring a reset and reconfig and some playing with the sequencing of the set up, the browser you use or, how you access the device's web page (Directly through your LAN, via the WAN through the forwarded port or putting the thing in the DMZ and hitting it directly. And despite repeated tries and a couple of calls to tech support. I have yet to be able to get the multi-camera view working utilizing the built-in interface.<br /><br />Foscam's tech support is hit or miss at best. And their standard answer seems to be reset the device and if that doesn't work, send it back.<br /><br />Having said that, once you get past the above issues and adjust for the camera's foibles, they work well once configured.<br /><br />After testing a number of remote apps on my various android devices, I wound up going with Blue Iris on my desktop and it's associated Android app. It was well worththe $10. It works very well with the Foscams and fairly well with the Moles.",12-10-2013

I returned this camera for two reasons:<br /><br />Foscam Tech Support was not able to figure out how to make this camera work on my home network even after two calls.<br /><br />To use this camera you will need to create a DNS host account and understand how to configure port forwarding on your router. The DNS host service, recommended by the Foscam installation, requires a $25 dollar annual fee. While there are other alternatives out there, I find it a bit disingenuous to say there are no hidden fees when the user guide directs you to a service that is not free.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the setup for this camera is not for the average person. The setup is significantly more complex than installing a modem, printer/scanner or an external hard drive. Foscam does provide a DVD that walks you through the process step by step. But configurations they walk you through are generic and are not likely to match your home network in many cases. You will have to reconcile the differences between your setup and the setup on the DVD. In my case, even the Foscam Tech Support people were not able to do this.",11-10-2013

These cameras work great, once you can figure out how to set it up.  Turns out, our router frequency had to be adjusted.  I called Customer Service the first night and I don't think they have many people working at night because I was on hold for over 45 minutes and was still the 7th person in line.  I figured they might have more staff working during the day and since most people are at work during the day and probably not setting up their cameras, they might have less calls.  I was connected to Albert within 2 mintutes of calling and he set up the wireless connection for both of my cameras and even set up the IP forwarding so that I could access the cameras remotely through an Android app called IP Cam Viewer Basic.  He helped me set up the app as well.  He was so polite and nice on the phone!  One of the best customer service experiences ever, once you can get through.<br /><br />The cameras themselves are awesome!  It does exactly as they say.  The pan/tilt function works well and the picture is pretty crisp and clear.  I am able to see exactly what is going on and the responsiveness is good.  I have not tried out the sound yet, but am looking forward to seeing how our puppies react when they hear our voice when we are not there.  The app on the phone does not allow voice unless you upgrade to the pay version.  We will see if we decide to do that.  All in all, I highly recommend this product!",11-10-2013

I love that they provide you with a remote monitoring method if you don't receive a static IP from your ISP.  Fortunately I have never had to deal with their customer service, which seems to be what many complaints are about here.  I would highly recommend these over a traditional baby monitor.  There is really no comparison.",03-10-2013

The picture is good and the control work good as well. You have to pay for the full app for you phone. I think that sucks. The problems started when I tried to set up the remote access through the web. You have to subscribe to a web host for a minimal charge in order to be able to view your camera remotely from the web. The instructions are very vague and the quality of the instruction video that is on the install CD is really poor. It looks like they took the picture with a toaster. You would think a camera company would have a pristine video. Well it has been two weeks and I have played with it a few time, but still no luck. I have two weeks to get this set up as I wanted it to check on my house when I go on a extended vacation. I just don't get why they have to make things so difficult. I am no dummy when it comes to computers and networking. If I do ever figure this thing out, I will probably buy one or two more to spread out in my house.<br /><br />Update 11/9/13: I called Foscam and they remoted on to my computer and set up the web browsing for me. Turns out that I had done everything right, it is just that you need to use a different network connection to view your camera over the web than the one the camera is on. They should state this loud and clear somewhere. Also, you do not need to sign up to a web host to get access. Foscam gives you a free connection. The remote app works great over WiFi or a wired connection, but is very sluggish and slow over a cell connection. I used this while we went on vacation for two weeks. You can set up alarms so when the camera detects sound or motion it will email you 6 pictures. Got worried one AM when it showed people in my house. Turns out it was the cleaning lady who got the dates mixed up. I was not able to figure out who was in the picture by sight, but when I put two and two together and figured out that was her normal day, I could see it was her. So, the picture could be better. I ordered a new one today for the bedroom. It is supposed to have a sharper picture, I will let you know.",03-10-2013

I highly recommend you read R. Tickle's excellent review of this product. It is spot on.<br /><br />Now to my review. Camara works great when it works. WIFI is very solid considering I have it all the way out in a detacted garage. Of course I have an ASUS AC66U wireless router/blowtorch, so that helps :)<br />I have it set to send my snap shots via email when movement is detected in my garage (thugs in my neighborhood like to kick in doors to garages) and this works great... if not filling up my inbox... which I just delete. I have the sensitivity set to the weakest setting, which curbs the false reads.<br /><br />Anyway, it has worked great for about 2 months after which the camera appears to have developed a reset glitch. Every 3-4 days, the camera will pan from the saved position toward the ceiling of my garage... well, that's no good.<br />I've checked for new firmware in a hopes Foscam might have addressed this issue. No Dice. I'm on their latest, so there is nothing I can do there.<br />Instead I have to going into the web based settings and pan the camera back to the desired position. I save the position, but it never saves.... again, a firmware issue.<br /><br />So, while it works, this is not a \\""set it ad forget it\\"" device.

I now have two cameras (one black and one white) that I purchased when they were on sale for 69 dollars.<br /><br />The setup is easy if you are viewing the cameras on your home internet but a little more difficult if you want to be able to view them away from home (ie a smart phone, Ipad or another computer).<br /><br />I will not get into the setup as I think it is explained on these different reviews.  However, if you have problems, there are various YouTube videos that will guide you in the right direction.  Having said that, it is intimidating to get it to work right, but once you do, it is quite rewarding.  The problem is really just dealing with stuff that you do not do on a daily basis; such as port forwarding, setting up a free IP provider, etc.  I spent some time before I finally was able to get it right.  The setup video that comes with the camera helps but there are some better YouTube videos out there.<br /><br />To test to see if you have it right, you should download some free apps and then use your 3g or 4g on your smart phone or Ipad, etc. to see if it works, otherwise you will just be seeing the camera on your home network on those devices.<br /><br />What is amazing to me is that you get a nice clear color picture from this camera; you are able to rotate it remotely; take pictures; record video and set up an alarm to take pictures at various times if the camera recognizes a visitor or intruder. It also has sound and I can talk to someone and hear them with audio enabled. Really unbelievable features for a reasonably priced camera.<br /><br />You can set up the alarm for the camera to work at certain times of the day right from the included software.  Many times I leave for work in the morning and when I arrive at my office, I have about five pictures that arrive by email showing my vehicle leaving the house.  If someone comes to the house and I am at the office, I will receive an emails showing pictures of them arriving.  The camera also has an option to snoop for sound which triggers the alarm.  If you have your computer on, it will beep if you so choose.<br /><br />My camera works out of my window and so it limits my ability to see at night with infrared. However, I also have one in the basement and the camera automatically adjust to the dark and I can see everything in total darkness.<br /><br />I am hoping to set up an outdoor camera in the future, but right now I am extremely please with the price, features and quality of these cameras.  Great buy in my opinion.",02-10-2013

I also hate when people rate products poorly for reasons that are not the product or the company's fault.  I struggled with this one because the product itself is really decent.  I've had these cameras for a while to watch my pets when I'm away and I've even got some for friends.  They do the job well and you don't need to be an expert to get it to work.  I've updated the firmware once and unfortunately it required me to manually input the IP address instead of using DHCP but no big deal.<br /><br />Now for the reason for my low rating:  Business practices and customer service should figure into ratings so customers are aware of the total package.  I can't speak for customer service since I've never had to use it but...<br /><br />There are many review that cover this product itself, so I'll leave that alone.  The biggest problem for this device for me comes with their email communications.  Having the latest firmware updates and patches for an IP camera for me is as important as operating system patches.  If you don't want someone taking advantage of a security flaw and viewing your cams, you should update them.  Therefore, I've signed up for Foscam's firmware updates email list.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they take advantage of you and I receive at least one sales pitch or promotional email from them every day.  I specifically did NOT sign up for that list.  The list I signed up for was the firmware updates.  It is NOT COOL to take advantage of your customers by spamming them while holding the carrot of security firmware updates over their heads.  Even FREE antivirus software definition updates don't spam you just to get updates.  Do you hear this Foscam?  NOT COOL!!!<br /><br />You have disgraced an otherwise 4+ star product.  I don't even read your emails anymore unless they say \\""firmware update\\"".  (and I sincerely hope that doesn't mean you will start putting \\""firmware update\\"" in youremail subject lines just for me to open them.)  For a while, I was OK just deleting them, but this is getting ridiculous.  PLEASE, reverse this inappropriate and disturbing business practice!  I'd rate this one star purely out of emotion, but it is an otherwise decent product, so please do yourself a favor and stop ticking off customers who just want to know when there is an important update.  I'm willing to bet most people buying these cameras aren't corporations with large needs.  You're not selling bathroom tissue or paper towels where customers are going to say \\""Gee, I'm really glad I got that coupon for another camera in my email, I was fresh out!\\""  Make a good product, they will find you...the power of the Internet...use it for GOOD things only, not to spam your customers!!",02-10-2013

Many reviewers have done a great job. I followed Tickle's step-by-step instruction and the installation was a breeze.<br /><br />In order to do the remote monitoring outside your house, you have to configure your router to allow you to get into your home network. The port forwarding setting is a task which varies from router to router. You will have to be a little network savvy in order to get this setting up. For example, I have a TrendNet router. The manual did not explain how to perform the port forwarding. I searched on internet and found an instruction which did not make 100% sense. I had to make a small guess and made it work.<br /><br />The best feature of this product is that, once the feature is turned on, it will email you your IP address if your network provider changes your IP address. During my recent trip to Asia, my IP address was changed 4 times. I could access my home network with new IP address. If there would be a hacker to my home network, he/she could not get in after IP address is changed. This makes me feel much better to open up my home network a bit. Still, as soon as I got home, I deactivate the port forwarding setting in my router just to be safe.<br /><br />The motion detection works well when I set the sensitivity to 5. I have a lamp which is turned on and off by a timer. The motion detection detected the light change and emailed me a series of photos. This is a good assurance feature. I get to see the photo twice a day even there was non event to let me know the Foscam is working hard to watch my house for me. When I got home after the trip, I triggered the motion detection. I was pleasantly informed via my email that my home was invaded with my pictures in there.<br /><br />The resolution of the camera is not very high. However, I had to set the resolution even lower in order to view it via my DSL which has limited upload speed. So, practically, I am limited by my internet connection. This makes me think about switching to other internet provider.<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera. Yet, you need to know how to set up your router to take a full advantage of it.",30-09-2013

Let me just say that the install software is garbage and did not detect this camera on my girlfriends house where i was installing it.  I \\""chatted\\"" online with a rep who decided she was unable to help me and referred me to telephone tech support.  called the 800 number and waited 15 mins.  i allowed remote access to my girlfriends computer and after 45 mins she stated she was unable to connect the camera with the uverse network.  (GF running windows xp).  so i take the camera home where i attempt to install it at my place to test.  Running Windows 8, the IP Camera Tool could not locate the wired camera connection here either.  I downloaded Blue Iris and was able to run my webcam to Blue Iris but would not detect the Foscam.  I attempted to give it a fixed IP by disabling the DHCP but unfortunately ATT Uverse requires DHCP for television and is impossible to disable this through your network.  I know this camera is working as it is night time now and you can see the network cat5 plug flashing & the IR lights are on.  All in all, i will never ever buy a Foscam again.  What is more expensive, an $80 camera that doesn't work or a $140 camera that does?<br /><br />**Update October 29th***<br /><br />I contacted Foscam after nobody could help me get this camera to work and they had me return it as it was believed it was a hardware problem (i bought a brand new broken camera).  Foscam sent me an \\""RMA Form\\"" to print out and fill out and went to the post office to send this back to Foscam.  I am still not happy about having to pay $12.95 with USPS to ship this non-working camera back.  Within a week, I received an email with a new tracking number and Foscam sent me back a new, working camera.  I received the camera within a week after that.  My initial reaction to this camera was that it actually worked when I plugged it in.  I installed it using a combination of following the instructions on the installation disk and via Youtube videos.  Setting up the free DNS through NoIp dot com was easy.  all in all, it took 4 hours for me to completely set this camera up.  However, if I had to do this again, it would probably take me 20-30 mins.<br /><br />The camera is pretty functional.  The night vision works extremely well and this camera has great features.  What this camera does NOT do well is take decent photos.  I have been testing this camera for the past week and any movement causes the pictures of someone to be blurry even with the motion compensation on.  Which means, you better hope that if you are unfortunate enough to have someone break into your place, they move extremely slow and occasionally stop to say cheese to the camera (and hope it is at the exact point when the camera is taking the picture).  This camera also functions less than desirable when pointed in the direction of any light source, including a window or sliding glass door even with the blinds closed. During the afternoon, sunlight that hits my closed blinds is enough to disrupt the camera from decent photos.  With the alarm setting, camera kicks off false alerts due to any change in light sources.  ie.  a partially cloudy day.  And if you are a Google Chrome user like me, you better get comfortable going back to Internet Explorer, as the camera software uses Java and only fully functions with the use of IE.  with Chrome or Firefox, you lose half the features including multicamera, frame rate adjustment, all audio functions, video recording, time stamp features and more.  I love using IP Cam Viewer on my phone where I can see my place from anywhere that has cell phone data connectivity (unfortunately for me, i use Sprint so that means \\""wherever I can get cell reception\\"").<br /><br />All in all, as a security camera, this camera is brilliant in letting you know someone is in your place when you're not home, however, it is not going tobe very reliable in giving you a clear picture of a persons face.  All in all, this camera has its shortcomings but it serves a purpose.  As long as you are aware of this cameras limitations, if it still continues to meet your purpose for it, you wont be disappointed.",27-09-2013

I like to purchase things on amazon and mozy on my way continuing life.<br /><br />however, I will add that after reading a ton of these reviews, and then reading the subsequent comments questioning the validity of the reviews, I would have to question them myself.<br /><br />I bought the product, then, per their instructions, updated the firmware after setting it up.<br /><br />I followed all the videos and whatever else provided, setup the dns, and wireless, to access the camera away from home.<br /><br />shortly after I discovered that the firmware upgrade made the wifi connectivity sufferable at best. I can no longer get full resolution, which results in a tiny 320xsomething small like 160 screenshot, entirely useless for surveillance.<br /><br />I contacted foscam, and this was the response from tech support. broken english and all,<br /><br />\\""<br />In the first, I doubted there was a reboot issue when light is too bright and the environment is very exquisite (light is very bright and has many grass and trees).<br />In such a special environment, the picture size may beyond the DSP buffer and camera will reboot.<br />However, you mention it will also happen at night.<br />It may caused by the drop wifi issue, please wired connect it to have a test.\\""<br /><br />basically, this 'amazing' tech support rep told me at first that the reflection of light and grass(detail in general) would cause the camera to have issues. He then tried to say it was due to the camera being outdoors.<br /><br />he finally settled on it being a connectivity issue due to the wireless...<br /><br />what is the point of buying a wireless camera if the wireless does not work?<br /><br />nonetheless, I ordered a replacement (quick service by amazon, running the ball on foscam's screwup), unfortunately, the replacement camera had even worse range...<br /><br />at 10-15 ft away, I would lose signal to the camera, even at the lower resolution.<br /><br />I was afraid to update the firmware on this, to make it possibly any worse.<br /><br />its a shame because the price is right, if the camera worked. I can even deal with the crappy mount. Just get better anchor/screw setup and you wont have any issues, that is, if you can get the camera to work with how you need it. I couldnt.<br /><br />foscam does offer a signal booster antenna, but based on the reviews, the signal booster is entirely useless as well. I think my ultimate resolution to this problem will be to return the new camera as well and go with another brand period.<br /><br />Foscam's reply to all of this, as a general statement, was that amazon sellers sell a 'knockoff', so they do not provide support..what a shame.<br /><br />its very rare that a product in the top 5 of any category happens to be so low quality..would not recommend this as a wireless camera at all..I guess it would be ok for wired purpose but then why spend the money towards a wireless camera at all?",25-09-2013

So far I've received one from Amazon and one from Foscam and both have been defective.<br /><br />Besides physically connecting the camera, the first thing I did was update the firmware and web UI to the latest version.  I would then put the camera through a couple of tests.  The issue I had with the camera I received directly from Foscam was that it would stop responding when I was manually panning.  I contacted the Foscam technical support to aid me with the issue.  The agent determined it was a hardware issue and recommended I issue an RMA for it.  Fair enough, I don't expect every camera coming off a production line to be perfect.<br /><br />A few days later, I received the one I ordered from Amazon late in the afternoon.  As with the first one, I updated both the firmware and web UI, connected the camera to my network and proceeded with testing the rest of the camera's features.  The camera worked fine and I was very satisfied with the results until the next morning.  I live in a tree lined street and this particular morning the sun was shining bright and early.  I go and check on the camera and it there is no picture.  I reboot it and the video feed appears for a few seconds and it reboots again and again and again.<br /><br />Since this was the second defective camera I received, I decided to check the Foscam forums and see if anyone else has the same issue.  To my disbelief, I found a 49 page thread outlining the exact same issue!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Apparently the issue appears when the camera has to process a \\""sunny scenic image\\"" and the only way to fix it, without physically opening and soldering a cable, is to have the DSP re-flashed by the manufacturer.  Over 140 cameras have been documented in this thread to have this issue.  Keep in mind that only a small percentage of owners actuallywill go to forums and even a smaller percentage will post their issue.<br /><br />If you look at the fist post on page 25 of the thread, Foscam has known about this issue since the beginning of this year and has yet to acknowledge it publicly.<br /><br />Here is an excerpt from the post I mentioned above:<br /><br />\\""For the issue that MJ cameras reboot when light is too bright and the environment is very exquisite, our engineers find the reason and provide the solution. The reason for this issue is that if the environment is special (light is very bright and has many grass and trees), the picture size may beyond the DSP buffer. It can solved by flash the the DSP driver of the sensor board. Please contact your reseller to have repair.<br /><br />Have a nice day!\\""<br /><br />When the product is up and running, it is a great and responsive camera.  I'm just appalled at the practice of this company.<br /><br />I will update this review when I receive and test my outdoor camera and RMA camera from Foscam.",24-09-2013

I was only able to drink 2 suds..... I was installing brackets as well :-).

Every review I have read about this app says this is not the case. I would love to review that program, but if it does not work for the dozens of persons who did buy it, I am not going to spend $7 to buy it. I can review the audio function when using this camera right out of the box however; audio is NON-EXISTENT. When you click on \\""audio\\"" the video cuts out and says I need to install VLC player as a plugin to use the audio function. The problem? I already exclusively use VLC as my default player. In other words, the audio DOES NOT WORK on a Mac unless you use a crash-happy browser like IE. **When I used PC my IE would crash daily. Maybe they fixed that since 2011.**<br /><br />The camera Pros:<br /><br />Love it. It is small but provides excellent bright day, cloudy day, and absolute blacked out night video. At night, the inside of my house is so dark, thanks to my blacked out window treatments, that my Rotty bumps into things. This camera sees it all!  Also, when the camera pans and tilts there is ZERO sound. I even stuck my ear next to the camera while on the \\""patrol\\"" setting and could not hear the motor working. Excellent for covert and clandestine surveillance. The patrol setting is a function where the camera will automatically pan (or tilt) from one directional stop all the way to the other in both axis'.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />No Audio. Not only cannot I not use the audio IN function (to my MBP), I cannot use the audio out either (to the camera from my MBP). So, as a baby monitor, this is useless unless all you want is a camera. I know that some will retort and say \\""Just use IE and the audio will work\\"" - NO. This camera is advertised as working with Mozilla, Safari, Mac, IPod, Ipad, and Iphone. There is nothing on the Foscam site (except for angry customer reviews) that even hint that the audio is only supported if you use a Microsoft product. So in other words, this fails to meet even a slight aspect of the mark advertised - hence the 3-stars.<br /><br />I originally bought FI8905W cameras that crashed every few minutes following the first day of use then they stopped working all together - they got returned quickly. As this is only the 2nd day of use for this camera - only time will tell if this is better than the FI8905W's. I really hope so!<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />A tech support individual named \\""Zohaib\\"" from Foscam emailed me today (only 2 days after submitting a support request - that was really fast) about not being able to get the audio to work while running Mozilla on a 10.8 Mac. His solution had NOTHING to do with Mozilla Firefox OR Mac. Their \\""help\\"" only contained instructions on how to get it to work on Microsoft IE on Win 7 & 8. I do not think they even read the support email requests - they just respond by copying and pasting a random response probably from a grab bag of sorts. Maybe they throw darts at a board containing multiple solutions. Not happy Bob, not Happy.<br /><br />I would return it because it is being sold under a completely false pretense of working with a Mac; however, the camera works great as a camera and it is the cheapest one I have been able to find. So, I will have to resign myself as voting 'for' their product in the current configuration and with the gross negligence in their marketing department by letting them keep my money - to my dismay. Because of their inability to even read my tech support request, I have downgraded my 3-star review to a 2 star review.

Anyone who is having problems, I suggest you first set it up to your router as described in the instruction book that comes with the camera.  Once you do this, and get the IP address, you can then detach it and take it anywhere in reach of your Wi-Fi.  Also the instruction book provides information that allows you to connect to the camera over the internet (away from your home/work Wi-Fi).  I was also able to easily set up the camera on my iPad and iPhone.",20-09-2013

Want to update the time and timezone on your camera?  No problem! Use the time sync via internet feature.

This camera has a good picture and adequate pan & tilt functions.  The coverage works fine for my installation.  It also supports two way audio and motion detection!  The FosCam software shipped with the unit is easy to setup and internet access works fine.  You can setup UserId and Password access.  There are many camera applications available on the android applications market.  I use TinyCam Pro.  It work's fine for my implementation of the camera.  Other software is available adding greater functionality and better support of multiple cameras (I. E. Blue Iris).  I will be adding more of these cameras to my network in the future.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />G.W.,09-09-2013

I read all the bad reviews and made a list of all the features that people claimed didn't work and I tested everything on my camera and it all worked perfectly. For a non-HD camera the video quality over wireless was really good.<br /><br />That is until about two weeks ago when I got an email from Foscam asking me to update to the newest Firmware to fix a security issue on the camera. (Apparently they had been receiving some bad press about it) So, I followed their instructions and updated to the newest firmware and now the camera no longer works using wireless. This makes the camera absolutely useless to me. I also found that you cannot downgrade the firmware. I'm still hoping that they will release another firmware soon to fix this.<br /><br />I started with firmware version: 11.37.2.49<br />and updated to: 11.37.2.51<br /><br />I found on the Foscam forums that there are two different firmwares for the FI8910W depending on the serial number. I verified that this is the correct version for my model camera.<br /><br />Serial numbers with VNT in them should upgrade to firmware versions 11.22.2.xx<br />Serial numbers with FR in them should upgrade to firmware versions 11.37.2.xx<br /><br />**Update**<br />I checked the Foscam support website again this weekend and found that there was another new firmware update for my camera. Version 11.37.2.52 was available so I downloaded it and updated the camera and now the wireless is working again. I added an extra star because this is a great camera when everything is working. If I hadn't had to wait 3 weeks for a firmware update to fix an issue with a previous firmware update, this camera would have received 5 stars easily.",03-09-2013

Even though I my job entails me operating a CCTV system of almost 500 cameras, I have actually never set one up. So I bought this camera well before the baby was due so I could play with it and see how to set it up and operate it.<br /><br />For the most part, it is exactly what I wanted. The picture is clear, but obviously not HD quality (I could not justify spending an extra $100 for the FI9821W which does 720P, when the video monitor end of this set-up is a non-retina screen iPod touch or our android phones). However it is very usable for our intended use.<br /><br />For night viewing, you will need to use the IR lighting on the camera, which does put the camera in \\""Black & white\\"" mode. Any camera that uses IR for night time viewing will do this.<br /><br />The instructions that come with the camera (10 page, 3” X 5” booklet) are about as worthless as possible. Instead of calling Foscam, I used the instructions on this website: [...] so that made things MUCH easier.<br /><br />I also am not using the “Blue Iris” program to access the camera. Once you figure out the IP address of the camera you access the camera through a web browser, there is an on screen interface you can use.  It is about a 1 second delay from moving the camera (via web interface) to the camera actually moving. I know the camera works with Chrome and IE.  With Chrome you can basically move the camera, and that is about it. With IE, you can configure the camera just about any way you want, including setting up various log-in’s and what access they have to the camera. The access levels are “Admin”, which gives that person complete control over everything the camera is capable of. “Second level is “User,” which allows someone to control the camera (but not change settings). The last is “Guest,” which only allows someone to see the video feed. Each user has their own sign-in and password that someone with “Admin” privileges can set.<br /><br />The bad thing is the camera has “reset” it self about once every 3 weeks. When this happens, the camera goes back to the factory default home position and sets the IR filter to “auto” (IR comes on when the light levels are low). It has not wiped any of the preset positions I set, or any of the users.<br /><br />On the home WiFi, we are getting about 45 Frames per second day time, and 60 at night with the IR. If we access the camera with our cell phones (using LTE cell data, not wifi) we get 20 FPS day time and 25 FPS at night.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with the camera, and would suggest it as a baby monitor.<br /><br />I did knock a star off for the random resets, and the lack of abilities you have with Crome",30-08-2013

I have very limited experience with surveillance cameras, I operate a small restaurant and have tested a Dropcam (which works very well) and now this Foscam. My goal is to eventually have a nine or ten camera system for monitoring staff and customer activity and for security.<br /><br />Product: Camera works very well but does not have built-in recording capability. Foscam provides software that enables you to use your own dedicated PC to record. Foscam's product description doesn't mention that you need a PC for this.<br /><br />Customer support: During install I was able to get all the way to the final step of turning up the camera from my laptop, thus my call for support. The rep with a Fillipino accent told me his name is 'Irish' but later admitted it was a fake name. The phone connection was poor, he was on a wireless phone, and it seemed like a difficult language barrier so I didn't mind when he suggested I allow him to remotely access my computer although looking back now I feel like it was his goal to act confused in order to gain access. 'Irish' turned up the camera so quickly I barely followed and he didn't try to explain the process. When I asked how to record he quickly suggested that I should open my email, which I did but with discomfort that he was remotely attached while I entered my username and password. The end result was that he showed me how the system could send snapshots to my email, which was not really a solution to my need for recording and I started to wonder what was really going on here. I decided to end the call but then he insisted that I open my Amazon account while he was still attached and he insisted I write a review right then. I told him I preferred to write a review after some time to use the product but he started offering me discounts to purchase additional equipment in exchange for a favorable review, so I went along with it at that moment. He ended the call very shortly after he got his review and didn't even bother to make sure I had the correct info to restart the camera on my own. Fortunately I was able to figure that out because I wasn't about to call back. After realizing I had just let a stranger on the phone remotely access my computer and watch me log on to email and my Amazon account I went back into both accounts and changed my passwords. This was a lesson for me. If in the future I have problems with this camera I will use email and online support and not let them log on to my computer again.<br /><br />Update 8-30-13  I've looked into options for continuous recording and realize that this is not the product for me even though they list recording as a feature of this camera. I plan to return the camera.",29-08-2013

This thing is killer, great panning, great tilt, memory functions, ability to be hooked up to the web, admin accounts and user accounts available.  Foscam also upgrades their firmware pretty regularly so that's definitely a plus too.  Colors look good for the resolution 640x480 and infrared looks amazing.

Our yard is flat but then drops off into a small canyon where we know there are mountain lions, and deer regularly come into the yard during the day. But some other creature is making a mess of the lawn (besides the gophers that is). I used my DSLR camera but had to leave the light on in the yard for that to take photos. I took 900 photos over three nights, one per minute, but caught nothing. I thought about getting an IR camera but expected them to be well into the multiple hundred dollars. This one surprised me.<br /><br />I received the Foscam F18910W today, took it out of the box, connected it to the router and it came right up working. The documentation gives quite a few steps to get it working but much of it was automatic on my computer. It didn't take more than a couple of minutes to get the WiFi working too. It also showed up on my iPod Touch browser easily as soon as I entered the IP address of the camera. My setup time from box to working on the WiFi was less than 10 minutes but then I'm tech savvy.<br /><br />Tonight I set the camera up on a small tripod under the covered patio and aimed it at the area I wanted to watch all night. I'm quite pleased that the IR lights up the area quite well. I can easily see 30 feet of the back yard clearly.<br /><br />For a camera with built in WiFi, that can be tilted and panned from the computer, that lights up the yard at night on the video, I'm quite pleased.<br /><br />Of course it would be nice to have HD video but the 0.3MP image is quite enough for us to see what animals come into the yard.<br /><br />The only problem I had was when I tried to record the video on my desktop computer the recorded files were not in the designated folder. It took me a couple of hours to get it working with the help of some Google searches. The problem was solved by running the 32 bit version of IE on my 64 bit system. Strange and a bit of a pain but at least it works.<br /><br />I have it configured to alarm when something moves in the yard, and to send me email with photos when it does. Fortunately there is no wind tonight so it won't be sending me photos all night long.<br /><br />The feature I wish it had would be if I could limit the horizontal scan. That is: there is a button to have the camera do a Horizontal Patrol but it swings from end to end, an arc of something like 270 degrees. I would like to limit both ends so it only swings about 150 degrees. But I can't find any controls for that desirable feature.<br /><br />I expect soon we'll know what animal is tearing up our yard.<br /><br />8/30/13 We discovered it has been a raccoon tearing up our grass. I'll add a short video.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with the operation of the camera. It has not dropped the WiFi connection after 3 days. It also automatically switches from IR to non-IR as the sun comes up and visa-versa at night.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/11/2013<br />This camera did exactly what we needed it to do. We were able to watch video of 4 skunks and a raccoon being caught in the traps placed by a professional trapper over a five night period. However I did find some bugs.<br /><br />1) The alarm feature has a time setting to disable alarms during the periods selected. It never worked for me. I would get alarms no matter how I set up that time control. The alarms would send me email, with photos, day or night even though I tried to disable daytime alarms. I got so many alarms that I had to disable them.<br /><br />2) Alarms would be triggered by the wind blowing the trees and bushes which is understood. But even on a calm night with the alarm sensitivity set to 7 or 8 it completely missed the large raccoon 8 to 10' from the camera.<br /><br />3) I think there is supposed to be a feature to capture video when an alarm goes off. I was capturing video24/7 so that may override the alarm video feature. But in any case it never recorded a video on an alarm.<br /><br />4) I set the date and time in the camera but all video files, showing the date and time within the video frame, were totally wrong in date and time. Not even this decade.<br /><br />Otherwise it did the trick. If I had it to do over again I'd buy the HD version so I could see more detail.24/7 so that may override the alarm video feature.

The pan-tilt works very well, and the wireless signal is great.  The software to view is exceptional on any platform - the app for android is great, and even viewing from any we browser is fully functional.  The setup is what brings the rating down for me.  Getting the camera on my local network was simple, but the DDNS server setup does not like to work with every router.  So to view from my phone or from work without paying for one of the supported DDNS options, I had to use port forwarding on my router.  This is fine unless you're like me and have a dynamic IP address, which means I will have to update how I access the camera away from home.  The dropcam handles this much better.  If you are decently tech savy, or at least patient enough to read how to setup the camera for port forwarding and don't mind having to update your remote settings every few months, this camera is a bargain.",25-08-2013

Bad design or just inferior product?","I purchased 2 of these cameras to use in my home (one for security, one as a baby monitor). The instructions to set this up were reasonable easy to follow. However, the problems on both cameras started very early on. The camera would drop off the network, and would not reconnect. So I am realistic and I know that network drops on even the best WiFi networks can happen. But the device would literally not reconnect. You had to power cycle it (i.e. unplug it) to get it back on the network. Not an easy proposition if you've placed the camera in a hard to reach place, or if you have to go into your sleeping childs room at night if you're using this as a baby monitor and wake him up fiddling with power cords in the dark.<br /><br />I worked with Foscam support for weeks...they tried all the usual suggestions (update firmware, check and verify no other wifi networks using same channel nearby, etc). Nothing panned out. They also tried the &#34;maybe this is interference from an appliance&#34; excuse...except all the other devices on the same network DO NOT DROP. Also, I even tried placing a d-link camera in the same room in the same location to test that theory, and it never dropped (when the others continued to do so).<br /><br />Foscam support finally recommended I exchange the cameras, but the chance of both cameras being bad were pretty slim. Thus, I will return both for a refund. i cannot recommend this product.<br /><br />PS:  They advertise that this camera works with iPhone and iPad, but people should be aware that they do not make their own app. Without a 3rd party app (most of which you must pay for) you will not get sound on iPhone or iPad.

It is very easy to install and to accomplish such a task.  The Foscam website has good instruction videos.<br /><br />However, if you want to access the camera from the internet when you are away from home, it will be difficult to nearly impossible to accomplish.  Direct streaming via HTTP for remote access requires “port forwarding.”  After spending a week trying, I gave up.  I do not believe it is the fault of Foscam, I think this problem exists with all IP cameras requiring port forwarding for direct streaming. I highly suspect that my ISP (Comcast) has control of all my ports.  I called Comcast many times; they have mysteriously hanged up my phone during several of these sessions, exactly when I asked them about the ports.<br /><br />I called Foscam three times; their technicians were courteous and willing to help.  From their end’s examination, my port forwarding setting is set up correctly.  They tried and I also tried, using my phone’s mobile network, to remotely access my camera – but without success.<br /><br />Regarding the software – the ip camera tool is very difficult to set up for recording on your hard drive.  It appears to be recording using avi file format, but if you go to the path where you saved the file, nothing existed.  I am using IE8, and the live video only can be viewed on 32-bit, not with a 64-bit IE8 browser.  Google’s Chrome also works, and actually it is easier to take a snap shot from there.<br />Another issue I discovered, regarding the ip camera tool, is that I was unable to successfully add another Foscam on the multi-device setting, so I can view both my cameras on the same page.<br /><br />The only internet access that I managed to make work is using the FTP setting on the camera.  The host website I use is Mangocam.  However, with this method you cannot control the camera, so there is no pan and tilt.  Also, the frame rate is poor.  The free subscription on Mangocam is one camera with 1fps.  You can also schedule video recordings with the free subscription, which works pretty good. Higher frame rates are available with paid subscriptions.<br /><br />I would like to know which ISPs will allow the customers to control some of the ports for personal IP camera monitoring purposes.  It seems that security cameras now the day are everywhere. I assumed it would be a breeze to connect an IP camera to my existing ISP broadband connection.  But I was shocked to discover that many ISPs will not allow this function.",18-08-2013

I didn't know this until i needed to see a room at night and didn't understand why i didn't see the low green glow of the room.  Foscam has come a long way with their products and software.<br /><br />Love the motion and sound sensor, but it really is too sensitive for what number its selected for. But i think thats a software problem.  Other than software, this is a great pan/tilt security camera and has a speaker in case you need to speak to someone on the other side of the camera.

Once you set them up and can see what you need to see, you will find they become a part of your life like the doors or windows. If they turn off for some reason you will feel anxious and want to immediately restore them to functional condition.<br /><br />I have a battery of these cameras covering the house. The monitor seriously feels like one of the windows. But instead of having to go to the window, move the curtains, and then look out, I just glance at the monitor. It is impossible to describe how life changing it is to be able to see what is going on outside of the house without having to look out a window or go outside.<br /><br />The neighbor's cats are always crawling around outside. If I hear a noise I can just look at the monitor to see if it is them or a person instead of having to go outside. Racoons are also always making a racket I always had to check on. Now I sit and watch them on the monitor while they snoop around.<br /><br />The cameras are a fantastic help with the delivery guys. Since I put one up on the doorway all of my packages are laid very carefully on the steps instead of being hurled up there like they used to be. The delivery guys are always polite and smiling when they see the camera looking at them.<br /><br /> I even ended up putting a monitor in every room to watch them. If I am cooking I can see who is at the door or out front. If I am in bed I can see what is going on. If I am in the dining room or living room I don't have to move a muscle to see who is knocking.<br /><br />I would not install them in the interior of a house though. The hacking threat is too great.<br /><br />You will find a million and one uses for these cameras and you will never be able to stop watching them once they are installed.",14-08-2013

But never got it to work with external access either.<br /><br />Bought the Foscam to replace it because of the IR filter and the report that Foscam had better tech support than the non-existant support of Wansview.<br /><br />Well.  #1, green worked! Yay! Nice to have green in your pictures after all!<br /><br />#2. While I had no problem getting the camera going wireless on our home network, and felt pretty good I'd done port forwarding correctly on my Netgear R6300 router. . . still no joy on external access.<br /><br />So I called Foscam Tech support. They were able to do a remote session, sign on to my computer, determine that my Comcast business internet ISP was the issue (it had a separate firewall setting that also needed port forwarding set in it), log into that and do it. . . and now my camera is viewable remotely from the public internet on my wife's smartphone and everybody is happy.<br /><br />I never, ever would have figured that out on my own, particularly since I actually called Comcast *first* to see if they might be the issue, and they claimed it was nothing to do with them! So I believed them!<br /><br />So thanks, Foscam, you made a very happy customer!",12-08-2013

I did a considerable amount of research prior to purchasing this and found it provided  capabilities better than cameras costing hundreds more.<br /><br />My criteria was I needed something 100% reliable that I could access from anywhere in the world with a web browser. (I have had no issues with the cameras dropping off line due to network issues. They have excellent reliability so I can be gone for an extended period of time and still monitor my home.)<br /><br />I needed a camera that did not use much internet bandwidth (this camera achieves that by only using bandwidth when you actually are asking it to send video plus you can record video locally without using outside bandwidth.)<br /><br />I needed something that could sense motion and/or sound and send me photos of the activity.<br /><br />I didn't want to upgrade my home network. I have a 12 year old wireless router. All three cameras work quite well and even work with my old G wireless router even when all three are sending video at once and someone else is using our network as well.<br /><br />The last nice thing is the setup was easy. I set it up using the CD (no issue there) and with DDNS but found I didn't really need to use that at all. The fact the camera will send me an email if my IP should change covers that. So far my Comcast based IP has never changed (in two years).,09-08-2013

I was very frustrated and emailed Foscam customer service, no response. Then I called the customer service, and I was told I need to pay shipping for both ways again if I want it to be replaced. I'm not happy with this answer since I don't want to keep paying for something without quality control. and then I was given someone's name and was told if I email her directly, my problem will be solved. Then I emailed, no response again.  Then I emailed customer service again, still no response.<br /><br />Now I don't know what I should do.

I had some trouble getting the wireless to work but after a dozen tries it finally worked.  It works in all the rooms inside my 1,100 square foot home.  Trying to take video of the outside with the camera inside was a problem at night.  The window reflected the IR light ring and you could not see outside.  I expected a higher resolution from the color video.  It is an OK camera.  I have not yet set it up for viewing outside my home wireless.  It seems time consuming to do it so I have put it off for a later date.  If you don't have any experience setting up wireless systems I don't recommend it.  I purchased it to get familiar with using a wireless camera.  For that purpose the cost is reasonable.  Storing images takes a lot of memory and I would recommend using a separate computer solely for this purpose.  Works better with Internet Explorer for me.

I have used different browsers with no luck.  That's not much of a problem, though, as I use my iPad to monitor the live video, and the app I use has perfect two-way audio.  That brings me to my only other complaint...the lack of an iOS and/or Android app provided by Foscam.  When I purchased this cameral, I assumed the manufacturer would have their own app and that it would be free to use.  I assumed wrong.  You have to use third-party apps, some of which are free.  However, the free ones, as you would expect, have very few features.  Most, if not all, do not allow two-way audio.  To get full functionality, plan on spending $3 to $6 for a good iOS app.<br /><br />Despite those issues, I still love the camera, and I will probably get another one in the near future.",04-08-2013

We like to use it on our iPhones/iPad with the FoscamPro paid software available on the apple store.

The alarm system is setup to call my cell phone whenever there is an activation. I then use the Foscam Viewer Lite app on my Android phone to connect to the camera and determine what activated the alarm. Worked well during our recent vacation, even though we had no alarms, I still checked in on the house every so often. Gave me some peace of mind.<br /><br />The setup instructions may be a bit too much for some people. I worked for many years in the computer & networking field, so even though the instructions were a bit confused I had the camera setup on my network in about 20 minutes. I use a static IP for the camera inside my LAN. I suggest you first configure it with a dynamic LAN IP and test it out, then use the static IP if necessary. I used the static IP as it was easier to configure my broadband router to do port forwarding with an IP rather than a MAC address. Your configuration may be different. The port forwarding option combined with a dynamic DNS service such as DynDNS or No-IP will let you connect to a public server within your LAN from the internet. In this case the public server is the HTTP (web) server built into the Foscam FI8910W. Once you get this setup you do not need your computer on; just have the cable/DSL modem and router powered and the camera of course.<br /><br />A couple of tips: remember to change the default user name and password in the device; second - don't connect to the camera as administrator from outside your LAN. I setup a viewer account and an operator account. The viewer can only see what the camera is pointing at (they can't move it), the operator can move the camera, but can't change the settings. The admin can do anything.<br /><br />Anyway worked good for me and my use, though a bit over complex to setup & configure for internet access (but the good thing is that it can be adapted to just about any network configuration or use). I only had one problem with connecting to it during vacation and that was after exiting the phone app without using the exit button in the app. This seemed to hang the camera, but a few hours later I tried it again and it was working. I was using the myfoscam.org dynamic DNS service they might have had an issue as I could not connect to the camera from a laptop either until some time passed.",30-07-2013

No audio unless using Explorer,"The setup was relatively easy. If you've had any experience programming your router you shouldn't have any problems. I followed the instructions and set up the service with DynDNS and everything worked as expected. (I did have one small hiccup. Although I did not see any mention of this in the printed or online manual, there is evidently a max number of characters that can be used for a password. I exceeded that limit and had to do a factory reset of the camera and enter new passwords.) I will say this, despite their instructions, I was not able to get audio to work in Firefox. I tried both 32bit and 64 bit versions of VLC, but kept getting the same error while logged into the camera. I searched high and low for a solution, but after reading numerous forum posts from around the web, determined that it won't work. Audio does work with Internet Explorer, though, via ActiveX. As a matter of fact, the camera interface is much nicer via the ActiveX plugin. So, if you want to hear through the camera (and the sound quality is poor), you'll have to use Internet Explorer (the horror). As for me, I'd rather not ever use IE and audio is not important, so I'm fine with Firefox. That said, the Foscam folks need to get to work and do a better job of creating a nice interface for Firefox or Chrome.",29-07-2013

I wanted something that I could view remotely from my desktop at work and my iPhone4.  I had done quite a bit of searching around for a solid IP camera before I settled on this.  I had looked at d-link, tenvis, wanscam, and others.  However, none of those had the number of views that Foscam had or the number of helpful setup tips.  Soo after long deliberation I decided this was reasonable to get even after I had some concerns related to reviews and security.  To break it down further -<br /><br />What I like:<br />+Price<br />+Size of the camera (It is not an extremely large camera by any means.  Good to keep \\""hidden\\"" in a tight location)<br />+IR cut (Adds a more realistic color.  Not washed out.  Take a look at AwkwardHamster's youtube video comparing other foscam models)<br />+Accessing the camera remotely (It's good once you get pass the setup portion, which I explain in my comments)<br />+Picture quality - Good (Don't expect it to be the sharpest quality.  You are not going to see a hair on the ground 5 feet away.  If you are expecting long distance use with this camera don't expect amazing quality images)<br />+Wide variety of settings<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />-Power cord (~3ft, who does that?)<br />-Reviews, a bit off topic but I want to make a comment about all of them.  Now I didn't like that so many reviews on Amazon start off by saying \\""I couldn't get my camera to connect so I contacted 'insert name here' from Foscam.  They connected the cameras in no time and were extremely helpful'.  At the time of this review 703 similar statements.  Now I find this somewhat fishy that 703 comments are similar.  It seems to me that it is a modified template for comments.  I can't say whether these statements are true or not but just keep it in mind that some if not all may be false comments.  Just my 2 cents.<br />-Minimal information on remote DNS providers.  DNS provider - used to access camera outside ofyour home network.<br />-Security encryption.  From what I have read in other comments this camera has no security when you try and remotely access this camera.  If you attempt to access it remotely your username/password is sent in \\""Plain Text\\"".  This means if you use public wifi your password can be \\""sniffed\\"" out.  Now this might of concern to some and others it's no big deal.  So I suggest for some to do more research on how to access your camera securely.  I personally plan on setting up the camera for viewing through a VPN (virtual private network).  I haven't done it yet but the goal is to purchase a router that has VPN capability and install tomato or dd-wrt.<br /><br />Stuck between like/don't like:<br />>Camera setup.  This is a tough one.  Many people say turn away from this camera unless you have a degree in computer science because it is almost impossible to setup.  This is not necessarily true if you find the right steps online.  I didn't follow the owners manual for the setup or use the CD the camera came with.  I followed one reviewers steps and I got the camera up and running in no time.<br /><br />Camera Setup:<br />I followed \\""R. Tickle's\\"" instructions from March 29, 2012 to set the camera up.  Here is what he used with slight modifications and explanations that may make it easier for some.<br /><br />1) Do NOT install the software on the CD.  The CD is used to try and find the camera.  On my first attempt to access my camera I did toss the CD in and install the software, but unfortunately I was left with a blank text box with no camera IP.  The manual said I should reinstall the software so I did.  That didn't work so I decided to find it using my router web login explained below.<br /><br />2) Connect the camera by Cat-5 wire to your router.  My camera came with a coiled up cat-5 cable.  You shouldn't have to go searching for one.<br /><br />3) Login to your router (via browser, for linksys it is 192.168.1.1) and find the IP address assigned to your camera.  This should be fairly easy to do especially if you have the Linksys smart router.  Navigate to your connected devices and copy the cameras IP address.<br /><br />4) Login to the camera at that IP address (via browser) and IMMEDIATELY turn OFF the DHCP.  Copy and Paste the IP address for the camera into a new blank tab and hit enter.  This should take you to the foscam page that shows activex, server push mode, and mobile phone.  If you use IE select activex, firefox/chrome use server push mode.  Selecting one of those will give you a pop-up for username/password.  The default username/password is : Username-admin, there is no password.  Once you get in you can navigate to \\""Basic Network Settings\\""  and uncheck DHCP.<br /><br />5) Give your camera a fixed IP address on your network and fill in the subnet mask with what you normally use.  This step is pretty simple.  You can assign your camera an IP address.  I used the IP it was initially assigned except I changed the last three numbers xxx.xxx.x.151.  Next you want to fill in the subnet mask, which can be found in your router settings or I believe it mostly is 255.255.255.0 (per google search of course).  Enter in your gateway IP and DNS server IP (you will use the same IP address for both of these.  you can find this IP address from your router login page in maybe a \\""local networks\\"" tab it should be the IP address of your router).  The last thing you can fill in is the HTTP port.  Select a four digit number such as \\""5252\\"".  Remember this because it will be used to setup port forwarding.  Now hit SUBMIT and wait for the camera to reboot.  Now that you have your IP address for your camera nailed down you may wish to go into your router and assign the IP camera a static IP address.  This ensures another device will not accidentally take your foscam IP address.<br /><br />6) Fill in the SSID, encryption type, and share key used by your wireless network.  Hit SUBMIT, this will reboot the camera.  Now you youcan unplug the camera from your router.  ***NOTE*** I have found that once you enable wireless on the camera it may take some time to actually connect to your wifi network.  So if you reboot your camera be patient (more than 1 minute patient).  Watch the camera for the green LED to have a steady and consistent blink.  Any hesitation in blinking means it has not connected yet.<br /><br />7) Re-login to the camera at the new fixed IP address to verify that everything's working and your settings have stayed.<br /><br />8) Login to your router and set a port-forwarding entry to map to the fixed IP address and HTTP port you gave your camera.  You will also have to enter in the device IP address, the one you just gave the camera.<br /><br />9) Now in order to access the camera remotely you will need a DDNS service.  Foscam now recommends \\""no-ip\\"" for free DNS instead of dydns.  Do a google search for it.  Create an account.  Foscam has their own service free for 3 years but after that you will have to pony up some money.  No-ip is free but and has one downfall, every 30 days you will need to say you will keep the DNS assigned to you.  I haven't had the service for more than 30 days, but from what I have found online you receive an email and have to navigate to a link that is in the email.  I guess this is the price you pay for a free service.<br /><br />10) Go back to your camera settings.  Select DDNS Service Settings then Select third party DDNS drop down and find no-ip.  Enter your username and password.  This is the information you used on the no-ip site to create an account.  Finally you will want to enter in the ddns host.  This is what you set up to be your camera website/host.  Example:  mycamera01(dot)no-ip(dot)biz.  Sorry about the dots, trying to avoid having information blocked.  Now click SUBMIT and wait for the camera to reboot.<br /><br />11) Now try and access your camera using your new host.  You can try this from 3G/4G to make sure you can connect outside your home network.  Open browser tab and enter in all the host information.  Using my example: mycamera01(dot)no-ip(dot)biz:5252.  If you notice I entered  :5252  after the host name.  This is because we changed it earlier in step 5.<br /><br />12) You now should be able to connect remotely.  Since the hard part is done go and change your username and password to the camera if you haven't done that yet.<br /><br />I hope these steps help lower the frustration of setting up this camera.<br /><br />My final comment!!<br />IP Camera APPS. I mentioned earlier that I had an iPhone and wanted to access the cameras for remote viewing.  After much searching I decided to download \\""LiveCams Pro\\"" right now $3.99 in the appstore.  I selected it after seeing others recommend it and seeing all the cameras they support.  I may or may not want a different camera manufacturer such as d-link and the app supports them.  However, this is not the only app available, Foscam has an app (not free) that you can download.  From what I have found it works well but other than that I haven't had experience with it.<br /><br />I will update with my opinion of the camera as time goes on.  Feel free to check back in a few months.",29-07-2013

I will preface with, it does take some setup and isn't absolutely the easiest thing to get working.  If you are tech savy or have someone in the family who is, buy it!  Once it is setup, it is dead simple to use.  You will need a stable network (wired or wireless) to use it, but I have had no problems.

Picture isn't HD quality, but for under $70, I wasn't expecting much. I really like that I with the pan and tilt function I can scan my whole living room/dining room area.

Makes me wonder how much of it is a case of user error, rather than hardware issues.  The Web GUI is moderate at best, but once you can work through the kinks and get everything set up, its not that bad.  Too be honest, i've seen a lot worse.  I saw a few reviews saying to avoid using the installation cd that came with the camera but it has some nice features which let you change camera settings without the need for the GUI.  making some setting changes a breeze.  Also, the Foscam Pro app is a MUST HAVE, well worth the 5.99 as it takes the camera's to a whole new level in terms of stability, functionality.<br /><br />The multi-cam set up was a bit flaky in terms of loading all the cameras on to 1 screen but again, most of the issues were because of the web GUI.  The two way audio is nothing crazy but it wasnt high on her priority list.  The pan/tilt feature works great, and has adjustable speed for the rate of motion.  The motion sensor works as described and I've set her up with a second hard drive to store all the recordings.  If you've never set up port forwarding and changed settings on your router, it may be difficult at first.  Seeing as i have done this numerous times, everything worked like a charm.  I recommend use DHCP, but once your router assigns the camera(s) an IP address, make it static so it is linked with that mac address.  so no matter what happens to the camera, when it reconnects, no other device will take its IP address.  Wireless signal seemed fine, but she has a small place with a very open floor plan so i never had any concerns on that being an issue.  The quality was as expected since its only 640x480, having a 720p resolution would have been nice but since the main purpose of the cameras are to be a \\""nanny cam\\"", its fine.  For those who download the app, one feature whichis great, is you can zoom in on the image at the time, and if you choose snap-shot or record it will keep the recording/image on your phone.  So hypothetically if you witness a robbery in progress through your cameras, they can steal your computer but you still have the recording handy on your phone/tablet.<br /><br />I liked the cameras so much that I am actually looking to ditch the cameras that came with my home security system and put these in instead!",24-07-2013

You can have the camera email you whenever motion is detected or set it to record continuously. The quality of the color picture is good. The camera will reset automatically if the power goes out, and no PC is needed other than initial setup. Once set up, you can unplug and move it from room to room. Just plug it back in and it goes back online. Only thing that would make it better is if you could mount it outdoors. But set it up by a window and it records outside activity just fine.",23-07-2013

It took me a while to figure out how to hook it up via wi-fi, but I found a youtube video that had a very simple explanation.  I followed the instructions that came with the camera, and downloaded the software for it.  The instructions were very easy to follow.  The only thing I had to do that is not mentioned in there is once the wi-fi router info (name, password) are programmed in the camera, unplug the camera and then take out the ethernet cable.  After that, plug the camera back in and the wi-fi should take over.  If you let the camera reboot and leave the ethernet cable in, it will take over and you won't get a wi-fi connection.<br /><br />I tried to call their customer support.  It was difficult to understand the person I was talking to and they wanted me to download software on my computer so they could have access to my computer in order to help.  I was not comfortable with that, and did not continue the call.  And as said, I was able to figure it out.  If I can do it, anyone can.  I'm no computer expert and it was easy.

Luckily my tech skills are almost top notch and I can manage but for others who aren't, might be a pain in the neck. DDNS needs to be simpler allowing people to just set it all up through a Foscam app perhaps or through their site.

This was my dream come true.  Plus it's remote viewing AND you can control the position of the camera. I LOVE IT!<br /><br />I've only had it for a couple weeks but it's been great. Let me preface that I haven't tried to use it past my cable modem, i.e. outside my local router. That's a cool feature as well, but not what I need.<br /><br />I pulled it out of the box, connected it to my router, installed software and BAM! I had access to the camera.  Then I configured for wireless and put the camera in the front window and had remote control. It was very easy. If you can set up a router, you can set up this camera (at least for local viewing).<br /><br />I've been recording my property for the past two weeks and I love it. How nice not to have to use a VCR to review video.<br /><br />I have a question however, is there a way to schedule recording aside from motion detection or alarms?  This is my only issue to date. I'd like to be able to record while I'm away and schedule it. I can always use some macro that clicks on record, then clicks off record and schedule that on my computer.<br /><br />There were a few issues setting it up, namely it didn't initially say what the admin password was in the manual which it later revealed. Also, I hide the SSID on my router and I had to give that up to use this camera. I wasn't happy about that, but at least it's password protected.<br /><br />Also, the IR night vision is amazing, but you really can't use it through a window which is what I wanted.<br /><br />Overall 5 stars. For $80 this made me very happy. Just what I wanted. I may get another for the backyard!  Good quality so far.<br /><br />WARNING: If you have an older router, I had a Cisco wireless-G router, this camera will mess up your router. When I turned on the camera and then turned on my computer, the computer would not recognize the router. I replaced the router with a new wireless-N and it works like a charm now.",22-07-2013

Don't bother with the CD just download the latest software.<br />The video setup instructions could be better, they are complete but not well done in places and a little tedious.  However; a big improvement over the written instructions.<br />Excellent pan and tilt range.<br />Nice long DC cord for power.<br />Includes a flexible mounting bracket.<br />Easy to put together and in service.<br />DHCP is now off by default.<br />If you know the camera name or IP you can just use that in the browser to get to the camera and not mes with the IP camera tool.<br />[update]<br />Works fine with my Kindle in 'phone mode so should work with any Android device.<br />[\update]<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Needs DC, there is no battery option. There are battery to AC converters but they cost more than the Foscam.<br />Takes up bandwidth on your 2.4GHz network--apparently will not work on the 5GHz band.<br />No way to program a scan. e.g. start at the bottom of the stairs scan up then scan horizontally down a hall or even just limit the scan travel. (A little unfair given the price price point.)<br />Need to get the camera running to determine the driver to use.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />No zoom (again given the price point not really expected.)<br />Plastic mounting bracket appears frigale.<br />To avoid power cord problems and eliminate the drain on WiFI bandwidth you can run Power over Ethernet cable to the camera. You need to run one line in any case.<br />[update]<br />The SW supplied with the camera is limited and you need something like the [[ASIN:B008YD80KC Blue Iris Professional - Supports Many IP Camera Brands Including Foscam and Agasio, Zone Motion Detection, H.264 Compression Recording,E-mail And SMS Text Messaging Alerts!]] software to get all the features you would like to have.<br />Audio on non-IE browsers requires a obscure plug with limited compatibility.<br />As the camera gains up (IR mode) the screen blinks and gets grainier.<br />IR limited to ~100m to see something is there and ~50M to see what.<br />Outside in bright sun you can see a large object (garbage truck) as recognizable at ~200M, and that something is there at 1000M.  But while you can see a person at ~60M there is no ability to recognizable faces beyond ~10M.<br />[\update]<br /><br />So far I haven't done any distance tests nor tried remote viewing on a 'phone. I'm strictly using the camera for remote surveillance when I am home. (Critter problems.)<br /><br />I will update after more experience and testing.",20-07-2013

It's now a year later and I can say I am 100% happy with this camera and highly recommend it.  We use it on our iPad with the Foscam Pro application - this application is only a couple $$ and it's worth it.  My mother-in-law is able to log in through her browser as well and watch her grandson sleeping or playing in his room.  The resolution is more than adequate and I always have a clear picture whether it's nighttime or during the day.  The IR functionality works perfect.  I was actually amazed that I could see as good in the dark as I could.  I even went into the room to make sure it was pitch dark.  The ability to pan around the room and have two way audio makes it even better.  Once you have this camera set up you will love it.<br /><br />So the cons.  I'm a techie and the set-up of this camera took quite a bit of research, going through forums, and watching videos.  I have AT&T and at the time there wasn't much documentation on how to set this up for my specific router so I had to go through trial and error.  A year later I'm sure there's better documentation available then there was for me.

Every other camera that tries to connect thru Wifi is slowwwwwwwwwww. It would take 10-15 seconds for the camera to pop up when I set up the far more expensive &#34;Dropcam&#34; when I was in my own home on the same network, and I believe they take up a ton of your bandwith. Foscam loads in an INSTANT from home. It seems to always be connected, making me feel much better unlike the other monitors that seem to connect whenever they feel like it. The image even loads in less than 5 seconds at my work guest server, which is the definition of INCREDIBLY slow. I was pretty amazed about that.<br /><br />Plus, Dropcam and other cameras had way way way less features in their app store as they only have THEIR app, it didn't pan/tilt, and they charged $10 a month if you wanted to record with it. And the notifications were terrible. Foscam has NUMEROUS apps on both Iphone and Droid, so you can test out many of them until you find the one that works for you (even has dedicated baby monitor apps with sound graphs and such). I use my old Droid phones as monitors now. Two-way talk works better than I think people give it credit, as the other 2 more expensive monitors I had sounded about the same or worse I thought. Plus, if you want, you can hook up a mini speaker to the camera since it even has audio jacks in the back.<br /><br />One thing I haven't heard people say - I thought the camera was pretty big. It was bigger than the others for sure (won't fit on a window sill), but it does come with a mount if you want to hang it on the wall somewhere. But, you can buy 2 for the price of 1 of the other ones, and I like how much it can pan around the room a lot more than I thought I would.<br /><br />Setup -<br /><br />For those that want to use this just to view when you are at home (like as a baby monitor), setup is a piece of cake. The install instructions have been updated it seems since many of the youtube postings (search &#34;awkwardhamster foscam&#34; and you'll find a ton of them), but they still help, so if you are feeling overwhelmed just watch those 15 min vids before doing anything and it will definitely help. To install from the CD, I clicked the 3rd folder (03_Central Management Software), then connected the camera power and ethernet cable, then opened the windows folder (01_For Windows OS) and it found my camera. Double click on it and follow the youtube video instructions to continue.<br /><br />As for setting it up to view from anywhere - yes, this was a royal pain in the arse. It SHOULD have been a lot easier as there are pretty good step by step instructions on how to do it via those youtube videos and even the instructions that come with it... however, for me, it just simply didn't work at first.<br /><br />The host site would just show it as not connected even after doing everything. After getting really pissed for about 20 minutes... POOF, the site just magically worked. At first I tried creating a no-ip.info address, and after that failed, the newer ones have their own website you can use if you enable it in the DDNS options. But... that one didn't work either.<br /><br />So I tried modifying like 30 different IP numbers, port forwarding numbers, changing passwords... all failing. Then, I don't even know what I did or how it happened, but I tried it again, and BOTH redirecting sites worked. I guess some of these server things just take time to load. I'd recommend creating the no-ip host site, set up the port forwarding numbers, then going out for dinner and coming back before trying anything.<br /><br />Other Camera Comparisons -<br /><br />Every other non-IP camera out there costs as much as it does because they try to make it &#34;simple.&#34; Once you figure this one out, I find it even simpler. You just have to remember/write down a few IP numbers, create some passwords, andonce you have it all, you can put them into your phone apps and forget about them for the time being. The thing that bothered me most with the other cameras is that none of their apps had a &#34;sound bar&#34; so that if the volume on my monitor is low, I could still see that the baby is crying because it would have those red bars showing up like a traditional monitor. IP cameras have plenty of apps that will do just that, and worlds more that I have yet to discover such as recording and taking pics and whatnot.<br /><br />I very much like my new toy, especially for under $100. The End.once you have it all, you can put them into your phone apps and forget about them for the time being.

The night vision and pan and tilt features alone would make it a huge leap up from the last time I shopped around for wireless cameras, about 5 years ago.<br /><br />The one serious drawback that drops this down from 5 stars to 3 for me, and might make it useless for other use cases, is that the connection drops out frequently and the power then needs to be reset for it to be usable again within a practical time frame.  Dropping the connection in and of itself may or may not be the camera's fault.  I do have it set up at the opposite end of the house from my router and a few other devices drop off my wireless network sometimes too.  However, of those other devices which do lose their connection, they seem to detect this quickly and automatically reconnect within a few minutes.  The Foscam camera will stay disconnected for hours.  The camera definitely drops its connection much more frequently than any of my other devices (and many of my devices don't drop it at all), and it should really try to reconnect on its own much more quickly.<br /><br />Resetting the power does cause the camera to reconnect to the network, so it is still of use to me since I am using it as a baby monitor and am therefore home and able to reset it when needed.  I imagine this wouldn't work so well if you wanted to use it as a security camera when away from home.  But for me, I've decided that the night vision and price make it worth the hassle of resetting.  I've come up with a few workarounds to ease the pain.<br /><br />First, I bought this remote controlled power switch so that I could turn the camera on and off from another room and not need to open the door and wake the baby:<br /><br />Woods 32555 Outdoor Remote Control Outlet Converter Kit<br />[[ASIN:B001Q9EFUK B001Q9EFUK]]<br /><br />Second, the camera seems to cut out less when I simply view a snapshot image rather than leave the video feed running.  I wonder if a lag in the videofeed might cause the server on the camera to get backed up to the point where something dies.  The snapshot is available at the URL \\""/snapshot.cgi\\"" on your camera's website.<br /><br />Third, in conjunction with using an image snapshot instead of the video feed, I have also installed and use the \\""Tab Auto Reload\\"" Firefox add-on.  I then put the snapshot in its own Firefox window and set it to automatically reload every 10 seconds.  That has been good enough so far and should presumably be less demanding on the camera's web server.",18-07-2013

It has very good low-light (black and white) operation.  It's easy to install, except for the audio.  It's cheap.<br /><br />Bad things:  Even though it advertises a 300,000 (640x480) pixel resolution, the actual resolution is probably about 76,800 (320x240) so the picture looks very fuzzy when you display it at 640x480 size.  I suspect that the base image is only 320x240, and that software is used to increase the pixels without actually increasing the optical resolution.  (It's just like using digital zoom on a digital camera as opposed to optical zoom.)<br /><br />There are no built-in recording options, so all you can do is look at it in real time.

If the camera is pointed at a scene with too much detail (trees, grass, wood grain, window screen, etc) the camera will fail by either freezing, displaying black or rebooting. This defect was introduced as the result of a sensor change in December 2012. It was first reported by users to Foscam in May of 2013. Foscam publicly confirmed this manufacturing defect as the DSP in December 2013 and they also put a repair procedure in place. This procedure involves shipping the newly purchased camera to a distributor in Texas for repair. I've personally sent two cameras in for repair; the first repair took 15 days and required a significant amount of effort to process including a BBB complaint. The second repair took 18 days to turn around and was processed easily. Oddly, the serial number of this second camera changed before/after the repair so they seem to have sent a different camera instead of repairing. Regardless, the camera now works. Other users have reported varying amounts of friction when attempting to process these repairs.<br /><br />This DSP problem is widespread among Foscam cameras. Many users potentially have cameras with the defect but do not observe the effects because the camera is not pointed at a scene with enough detail to trigger the fault. Other users may observe the defect but incorrectly identify the problem as cabling or other networking gear. At last check, 423 faulty cameras have been reported in the Foscam forums. These forums detail this defect extensively, and also offer a DIY solution for users brave enough to open the camera up and fab a custom USB cable to interface with the DSP. This forum thread can be found by doing a web search for \\""MJPEG Cameras hanging rebooting based on image data.\\"" The defect is reproduced by many users with a variety of Foscam models.<br /><br />A review has been posted to each of these confirmed models. This includes Foscam models 8904, 8905, 8906, 8910, 8916, and 8919. However, be aware that the defect may exist on additional models as well. Amazon is aware of these details being documented on multiple reviews for different models. Please see the update at the bottom of this review for more information regarding this.<br /><br />Foscam currently claims that all cameras purchased from specific retailers as of November 2013 have the issue 100% resolved. Unfortunately, the forums show 111 faulty cameras reported from 11/1 through 12/10. To be fair, some users have reported purchasing non-faulty cameras and hopefully this will continue. But other users (as of February 2014) continue to report new cameras from these specific retailers with the defect. Unfortunately, purchasing a Foscam camera continues to be a gamble.<br /><br />There is a relatively simple way to verify if a specific camera has the DSP bug. The Foscam web GUI has the option to capture a snapshot. Faulty cameras that have the DSP bug are not able to capture a snapshot greater than ~60K. If a camera is able to capture a snapshot above this threshold then it does not have the bug. If the snapshot is smaller than 60K then the current scene does not have enough detail to verify if the bug is present. The camera will need to be pointed at a more complex scene and tested again until a snapshot greater than ~60K is achieved or failure is observed. Faulty cameras that have been repaired by Foscam can also capture above the ~60K threshold.<br /><br />I do not recommend buying this camera, or any other Foscam MJPEG camera unless you want to gamble with this known and confirmed freezing/black/rebooting problem. Based on the quality of support I recommend staying away from all Foscam cameras in general. They are inexpensive, but your time and sanity are worth a far greater value.<br /><br />:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::<br />::::Foscam posted a response to this review. If you are seeking additional information, my comments on the response are below::::<br /><br />Foscam US, thank you for the response. I have been close to this issue since the defect was first brought to Foscam's attention in May and this is the first public acknowledgement that I am aware of. Previously this had only been acknowledged privately through email/phone. As there are currently 62,997 views on this topic in the Foscam forums and over 400 reported faulty cameras I'm glad that there is now an \\""official\\"" acknowledgement of this defect.<br /><br />I do contend with some of the statements you provided as these statements do not match the current experience from actual users.<br /><br />----------------------------------<br />Foscam US - \\""all cameras currently sold by Foscam US through the Foscam US website as well as through Amazon.com direct and the Amazon store \\""Foscam Digital Technologies LLC\\"" have the issue 100% resolved as of November 2013\\""<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />This is simply not true. Users continue to report faulty cameras from these sources. It is also worth noting that several times over the last 7 months Foscam support told users (privately over email/phone) that the defect has been fixed and newly purchased cameras will function correctly. Regardless of these statements by Foscam, users continue to report defects. Data from 11/01 through 12/10 shows that 111 additional faulty cameras have been reported since November 1. Time may show otherwise, I hope it does, but currently this statement is simply not true.<br /><br />----------------------------------<br />Foscam US - \\""Furthermore, Foscam US (not the manufacturer which is Foscam China) is willing to replace any cameras free of charge (shipping cost covered both ways) which are suffering from this defect\\""<br />----------------------------------<br /><br />This is also simply not true (unless this policy very recently changed). I have 50+ emails back and forth with Foscam support detailing exactly how difficult it is to process the repair. My experience was not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences. Since 8/23 there have been 7 BBB complaints; overall the BBB gives Foscam a D rating. However, if these policies have recently changed then I applaud the decision to reverse Foscam's previous policy. (Amazon Review Update: Credit where credit is due, my second repair was processed smoothly so this process may indeed be getting easier)<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />1) Foscam's response claims that cameras sold from specific retailers have the issue resolved as of November 2013. This is simply not true based on consumer reports.<br />2) The response also claims that Foscam US will replace faulty cameras free of charge. If that is true, then that is a change in policy and a step in the right direction. However, many users outside of the US are also reporting faulty cameras. Unless the manufacturer (not simply a US distributor) steps up to repair the cameras, then these international users are still without a repair solution for their faulty cameras. Foscam the manufacturer needs to assist users in correcting this defect.<br /><br />--The referenced data and user experiences above are detailed in the Foscam forums and from the BBB.--<br /><br />:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::<br />:::: Update Regarding Multiple Reviews ::::<br /><br />On 2/17 a version of this review was pulled-down from the Foscam 8919 listing.

It is always good to see a system/process that works as intended.ial manipulation by Foscam.<br /><br />Update:<br />It has now been two months and I (and other users) continue to communicate with Foscam. The cause of this error was likely a sensor change that was introduced by Foscam in late 2012. It took several months before this hardware change trickled into the consumer market. The reason that Foscam has been unable to reproduce the problem is because they have been testing on older lab units; this problem only exists on units that have been manufactured since implementing the sensor change in late 2012. The forum thread mentioned above currently contains 82 cameras documented with this problem and 14 RMA's where the replacement cameras have also exhibited the same problem. One of Foscam's resellers has sent them a camera that exhibits the problem, but Foscam has remained silent on confirming any of the testing results from this specific camera. As it currently stands, the faulty cameras are likely still being produced and Foscam continues to fail in providing a solution for current/future owners. The bad news is that it took months for the hardware change to make it into the consumer pipeline. If Foscam ever decides to actually fix this issue by changing the sensor, then it will likely again take months before the new functional hardware makes it into consumer's hands. Even then, there will probably be pockets of old hardware still trickling out to consumers.<br /><br />Update 2:<br />After 39 e-mails back and forth, I just recieved a confirmation from Foscam of this hardware problem. The e-mail is below.<br /><br />\\""For the issue that MJ cameras reboot when light is too bright and the environment is very exquisite, our engineers find the reason and provide the solution. The reason for this issue is that if the environment is special (light is very bright and has many grass and trees), the picture size may beyond the DSP buffer. It can solved by flash the the DSP driver of the sensor board. Please contact your reseller to have repair.<br /><br />Have a nice day!\\""<br /><br />It is unclear if Foscam plans on continuing to manufacture the cameras with the DSP bug or if they will begin reflashing the DSP as a part of manufacturing. Based on their track record, if they do plan on making a change I doubt it will be any time soon. To correct the problem current cameras need to be shipped back and the DSP must be flashed. It is good that Foscam has confirmed the problem and can provide a fix for ambitious current camera owners. But, I think we are going to continue to have new users purchasing faulty hardware and identifying this problem for a significant amount of time.<br /><br />Update 3:<br />This update will repeat some if the information already available in the quick summary up top. Foscam has now provided a repair solution. However, they have also claimed that Foscam (the manufacturer) is not responsible for the repair of this manufacturing defect. Foscam claims it is the individual resellers, in this case Amazon, who are responsible for repairing the cameras. I wholeheartedly disagree with this, but that is Foscam's stance. Users in the forums have compiled the steps of this repair procedure together along with a list of required parts/cable as a DIY project. The DIY repair will likely void your warranty on a brand new camera, but it is good to know that this option exists. The end result of this issue is that the defect has been confirmed by Foscam and a repair solution has been provided. But, they claim no responsibility in actually performing the repair. Foscam has been the definition of difficult through the entire process and so I do not recommend buying any Foscam cameras. I recommend finding an alternative even if it costs a little more money, your time and sanity are worth it.<br /><br />Update 4:<br />On 2/17 this review was pulled-down from the Foscam 8919 listing.

Here are detailed setup instructions:,"This camera is great for use as a Baby Monitor.  I used it with the FoscamPro app on my iPhone and iPod Touch, which with the audio on will run in the background so you can still use your phone, or just lock the screen and set it next to you.  It works great with the latest Firmware and Web UI updates on my PC in Chrome and IE.  It also works great my iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch in the Chrome and Safari apps (although I use the FoscamPro app normally).    The instructions for the camera aren't very good though, and the software is completely unnecessary.  Instead, manage it all through your web browser.  Here's detailed instructions:    1) Do NOT install the software on the CD.  2) Look on the bottom of the camera and write down both \\""MAC ID\\"" numbers listed.  One should be on a sticker that says your default username and password (also write down), and the other is probably on a sticker with the serial number listed.  The first is your Wireless MAC ID, the second is your wired MAC ID.  3) Connect the camera by Cat-5 wire to your router, and plug the power cord in.  Let it boot up.  4) Login to your router via internet browser on your computer  4a. If you don't know how, Google your router's name online to find the typical IP address and password - a common IP is: 192.168.0.1 with a blank username or username of \\""admin\\"" and the password is usually \\""admin\\""  4b. Use Airport utility if using an Apple router  5) Navigate through your router's settings to find the IP address assigned to your camera.  6) Login to the camera at that IP address via web browser (e.g. \\""[...]\\"" where the \\""192.168.0.15\\"" is the IP address and the \\""80\\"" is the port number...80 is default, you can change it)  6a. Go to Device Management  6ai. Basic Network Settings:  6aii. Check \\""Obtain IP from DHCP Server\\""  6aiii. Choose a HTTP Port (any number 4 digits long)  6aiv. Uncheck \\""Network Lamp\\"" (turns off one of the 2 blinking LEDs on the back of the camera)  6av. Click Submit  6b. Go to Wireless LAN Settings  6bi. Check \\""Using Wireless LAN\\""  6bii. Enter your network SSID (the name of your network)  6biii. Choose your encryption type  6biv. Type your network password  6bv. Click Submit  7) Go back to your router's settings and navigate through the settings to find the \\""DHCP Reservations\\"" or \\""Address Allocations\\"" settings.  7a. If all the devices are listed, find your camera.  It should be listed twice now, as it's connected wired and wirelessly.  Give both of them a reserved IP address.  7b. If your router assigns IP reservations by MAC ID, then type in the wireless MAC ID your wrote down at the beginning, and assign it an IP.  Do the same for the wired MAC ID.  7c. Either way, write down the IP address you choose for both.  The whole point of this is that when you log into your camera you'll need the IP.  If you don't set a reservation, every time the router or your camera restarts you'll have to look up the new IP address.  This way it'll be the same forever.  7d. Apply your settings and restart the router.  7e. Remove power from your camera and don't reapply power until after the router is fully booted.  Feel free to put your camera where you want it, whether it remains wired in or you unplug it and use it wirelessly.  8) Once everything is back on, re-login into your camera at the IP address you specified (e.g. \\""[...]\\"" where the \\""192.168.0.15\\"" is your IP address and the \\""80\\"" is your port number)  8a. If the stickers were swapped, you may have to try the other IP number (wired vs wireless), sometimes they are backwards.  8b. Alias Settings - Set a name for your camera if you want  8c. Date&Time Settings - Set it for where you are  8d. Users Settings - Set up usernames and passwords and restrictions if you like (I recommend changing it from the default username and password)  8e. ADSL Settings, UPnP Settings, DDNS Service Settings, MSN Settings, and FTP Service Settings can all be left alone - Advanced users can set as required.  8f. Mail Service Settings - you can put in your email address and check \\""Report Internet IP by Mail\\"" so whenever your internet provider changes your external IP you get an email with the new one (this is mainly if you want your video stream accessible outside of your home)  8g. Alarm Service Settings - Self Explanatory  8h. PTZ Settings - Leave alone unless the Pan and Tilt feature is too fast or slow for your preference.  8i. Upgrade Device Firmware - For update Firmware.  Go to Foscam's website, and find Firmware updates in their Support area.  The website guides you through updating.  8j. Backup & Restore Settings, Restore Factory Settings, Reboot Device, and Log - Self explanatory  9) If you want to access it from anywhere, there are a bunch of setup instructions on Foscam's website that are specific to your type of router.  I don't have this set up, so I'm not much help here.",13-07-2013

They are very easy to setup and work well.  We have an android phone and an iOS phone and I was able to get them setup to view on both without to many problems.  The remote view can be temperamental at times as it does drop but it usually comes back fairly quick.  On the android we are using IP CAM VIEWER PRO and on the Iphone we are using Foscam Surveillance Pro.<br /><br />We have ordered 2 more of these which came today and I will write a separate review on those.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Did not realize that this was for all my cameras so I wanted to add the feedback since I setup the others.  We now have 3, 2 working and 1 being returned and replaced as the unit is bad.<br /><br />The 2 working ones are all setup and work great together and I can view both in both android and iOS apps!!!",11-07-2013

(Yes I am one of those over-protective pet-mommies!) I originally bought the Cisco WVC80N but since it didn't pan or tilt I had to buy 4 just to cover half of the blind spots in the room and my dogs like to wander, so at $100 each that was getting too expensive, plus they didn't have 2 way audio, just one way and no night vision. Then I saw this Foscam and since it had good reviews I decided to give it a try. I absolutely love it!<br /><br />Setup was a breeze and I had it working in under a minute (i'm a bit of an electronics geeks so this may not be an average time estimate).<br /><br />The interface is easy to use and gives you multiple options to access the camera feed based on the browser you are using. I've tried it with IE, Firefox, and Chrome and IE gives you the most features (due to ActiveX) but I swear the resolution is better with Firefox (this could be because the image is slightly smaller and so it just appears better quality).<br /><br />I'm not overly thrilled with the Foscam Android app, as it didn't have controls to move the camera but it does have the 2 way audio. However there are plenty of other IP cam apps out there that you can use to control it, I use IPCamViewer Basic.<br /><br />The audio isn't the best, there tends to be feedback when you try to use the microphone while listening to the audio through speakers but its clear enough that my dogs seem to recognize my voice. I used it during a recent thunderstorm to calm my dogs while I was at work.<br /><br />The highest resolution the camera has is 640x480 which isn't the best but its good enough. There is a higher resolution camera from Foscam (I think its the 9810?) that looks like this one for $100 more but for my purposes, and probably most peoples purposes, this resolution is fine. Even in night vision mode the resolution is still pretty decent (at least for a networkcamera). And by the way night vision mode is awesome! I can easily make out my little pups when they are hiding in the dark corner when the world outside gets too scary.<br /><br />Overall I can't say enough good things about this camera. I highly recommend it, for its price point I think its one of the best on the market. Though a warning to all pet parents who have nosy animals, make sure you put it up high. When I first got the camera (before I mounted it) I set it on a high table and one of my dogs found it and started sticking his face into the camera and even now that i've mounted it I find him frequently staring directly into the camera. :-)",09-07-2013

We wanted to be able to check in on our puppy while we are at work (nerds, I know!).  This camera is under $100 and has so many features! I get a clear feed on my laptop, iPad and iPhone!  I can control the direction the camera point remotely. It has \\""night vision\\"" which is cool (if not creepy). It is wireless so we can hook it up anywhere somewhat near an electrical outlet. The only two improvements that may be available in other models would be a zoom lens and full HD quality. But I do not need those features myself.<br /><br />TWO IMPORTANT NOTES:<br /><br />1) Setting up this camera for remote access on the internet can be DIFFICULT. It requires you to do advanced setting on your home router that you probably are not comfortable with. I would recommend doing a Google search for Foscam + your router's brand/make. You will find specific instructions out there (maybe even in a video format) that will show you exactly what settings you need to change. If your ISP assigns you a dynamic IP, you will also need to sign up for a service like No-IP.com provides. So, again, that's more \\""pain in the butt\\"" setup for you. Once you get past the setup, the thing works GREAT!<br /><br />2) If you are using an iPad/iPhone to view the video feed, download the app \\""FoscamPro\\"".  It cost maybe $5 but it is SO much better than trying to watch via Safari. That $5 price does get you the app on both your iPad and iPhone if you have both.<br /><br />Overall, I really like what I am getting from this camera and would definitely buy another if we need it.",08-07-2013

This is my first IP camera and bought it mainly to watch the interior of my home while I'm away.  Setting it up was a bit tricky.  The included CD disc is a bit worthless as it does not install anything on your computer, you must find the file you want then load it.  I have found that you really don't need the disc to setup your camera.  What you do need is a good understanding of your routers menus and interface and port forwarding.  To use this as a wireless camera and to remotely access it via the internet or a smartphone or tablet app, you need to set up the IP address of the camera and the router followed by the port assigned to the camera, which is done manually via your routers setup.  After many hours of tinkering, I finally got everything working with the internet and the foscam app for my android devices.  Setting up the email alerts was easy once I figured out that I had to reset camera to factory defaults, start over and then setup email.  Foscam support says that Gmail is not supported but it is and works fine with this model.  After all of the learning curves, this is a great camera and I will be buying a few more.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good picture<br />Low light settings work very good<br />Remote access<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very tricky to set up at first<br />Audio is sketchy",07-07-2013

Ordered via Amazon (sold and fulfilled by Amazon). Foscam now states that they do consider Amazon to be an authorized reseller, so at least that is an improvement from the past.<br /><br />My computer is an iMac running OSX 10.8.4. My router was made by Netgear.<br /><br />Setup:<br />-I followed the instructions and plugged the camera into my router with ethernet wire supplied. Plugged in power cable also.<br />-Installed the IP Camera Tool software (provided on the CD) onto my iMac. Logged into the camera via the software and everything looked good. Next, I needed to unplug the wire to set it up for wireless use on my home network.<br />-First step of \\""specifying an http port number\\"" other than 80 was fairly simple. Keep in mind that I really don't know what they mean by all the \\""port\\"" talk. I just followed the instructions and everything went smoothly at this point.<br />-My internet service supplier (Comcast) gives me a \\""static IP address\\"", i.e. it always stays the same number no matter when I use my computer. So I could skip all of the DynamicIP Address stuff. I think that made it a lot easier for me.<br />-At this point, the badly written installation manual makes it seem like you might be done, but no. Onward...<br />-Next step was \\""port forwarding\\"", whatever that means. The tricky thing here (for novices) is that the manual just says \\""login to the router\\"". Uhh...what the hell? How do I do that?! No instructions. (At this point, the techy people reading this review are slapping their foreheads and/or getting a cramp from laughing).<br />-I finally figured out how to get logged into my Netgear router by going to Netgear's website.<br />-Then I followed the instructions to setup \\""port forwarding\\"".<br /><br />At that point, I could get on the internet and go to the correct URL (they explain how to figure this out) and see the camera's view. Everything worked ok.<br /><br />Before I went any further, I used the IP Camera Software again to change the password for the camera. (the default is no password which did not sound very secure).<br /><br />So far, so good. Only problem is that when you use a Mac computer to view the camera, you can not hear any audio. After doing some research on the internet, there seems to be no way to solve this problem at this point.<br /><br />BUT the good news is that if you use the iCam app on your iPhone or iPad (like I do) then you will be able to hear the audio and see the video as well as control the pan/tilt of the camera.<br /><br />So for me, everything works fine, but it was a bit of a headache to set it up. The installation manual needs a thorough re-write by a NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER who tests the process each step of the way. Note that this is different than getting a native English speaker to brush up the grammar on the badly written manual. There needs to be a much simpler logic and flow written into the installation manual. Amazing that Foscam can not figure this out yet after thousands of complaints on Amazon.<br /><br />Finally, I just want to say that I feel there are hundreds of fake reviews here on Amazon for this product. Typically they are short, give 5 stars, and mention what great tech support they received from Mary, Lisa, Juan, etc. Another Amazon reviewer mentioned that it appears these fake reviews are being done by Foscam's tech support staff overseas. I am not sure if these allegations are true, but they sound genuine to me. In my view, if this is true, these fraudulent reviews must be stopped and past ones must be deleted by Foscam/Amazon. This is serious unethical behavior! Minus one star on this review as a penalty.<br /><br />Summary, it's a 4 star product with a 2 star installation manual for an average of 3 stars, BUT minus one star for unethical fake reviews allegedly by Foscam tech support staff. Total = 2 stars.e star for unethical fake reviews allegedly by Foscam tech support staff. Total = 2 stars.",27-06-2013

I had a bit of a learning curve setting up the first camera over ethernet, then finally figured out the dsl modem settings and have used both cameras successfully from within my local area network WiFi. I work on Macs and found the supplied IP Camera Tool didn't reveal my camera id's at all. After searching for more information and a little trial and error succeeded at identifying the cameras. Now a month or so later decided to setup the 'Mail Alert' settings to no avail after several attempts. I did some searching online and not finding correct settings for using Apple iCloud SMTP server finally resorted to contacting Technical Support at Foscam via their website. I spoke to Andrew and he helped me to download the proper remote access software tool. He was then able to guide me through the correct settings for my email and server settings, all within about 15 or 20 minutes. I must say the tech support from Andrew at Foscam is fantastic and I highly recommend his help.

The first was a Foscam clone with the same features as this for about 1/3rd less.  Quality of video is similar but setup on the Foscam is easier.<br /><br />In almost a year, it has never failed and I've never had to contact support.  I view my cameras on the Mac, Windows 8, iPad, iPhone and Android tablet using free or very low cost software.<br /><br />I'm here today not just to leave this review but to buy another one.  I use them for security cameras and to monitor my 86 year old mother-in-law who lives alone four miles away.  I'd gotten used to being able to check on her.  We just moved her to another house and I haven't moved the camera yet.  This morning I found that she didn't answer an automated phone call I set up to remind her to give her dog his epilepsy pill.  So I called her only to get a busy signal.  So I drove over to find the phone knocked off the hook and her reading a book.  If I'd had the camera set up again, one click would have reassured me that she was OK.<br /><br />These cameras a great for that use.  If you need razor sharp HD recording for evidence in criminal cases, no... nothing in this price range will suit.  But if you want to have a reliable way of checking on a room, this is very hard to beat.<br /><br />The best feature is the night-vision.  The infra-red LEDS do a great job if lighting up a wall over 20 feet away.  In fact, it is difficult for me to distinguish between interior night vision and daytime video in one of the rooms (there's no much color in the room.)",16-06-2013

I first connected the camera directly to my router via the supplied Ethernet cable, installed the camera s/w that came with it on my Windows 7 system and followed the easy instructions in the manual. It gets an IP address from the router and in my case decided to use a fixed mode (preferable to DHCP as the number will never change). It also asks you for a port number (you pick a number between 1000 and 20,000) which is used later for monitoring from outside your own house network. Write down the IP address of the camera and the port number that you have chosen as you will need it later.<br /><br />I then disconnected the camera from the router, unplugged the power cord and rebooted it. I was then able to place the camera anywhere in the house and see the video on my laptop using a browser. All the camera needs is a power outlet. I added an add-on to my browser and was also able to hear sound from the room where the camera was located and was also able to talk to anyone in the room - with significant delay, but very useable. The is basically a web server. From the webpage that you receive from the camera, you can move the lens left ant right and up and down. If there is not enough light in the room, you can also turn the Infrared mode on. What you see is a B&W image, even if it is in the middle of the night with the room completely dark. I then tested it using my laptop running Windows Vista and it worked fine. No s/w to install, all you use is your browser (IE, Firefox, Chrome or Safari which you point to the IP address of your camera (more on this later). It also works fine from mobile devices like iPhones, iPads, Android tablets and Android phones. I tried them all. The only things missing from the iOS and Android devices is the audio as no plugin is available for those devices.<br /><br />There are many other services that you can setup (like sending you an email in response to motion or sound in the room). These are not described in the little manual that comes with the camera but are fully described in the User Manual found online for this camera. You can change all these setting from the same web screen where your video shows up.<br /><br />My next step was to add the ability to view the video stream from outside my home network. This setup is well described in the online User Manual. It is simple but involves you logging into your router and set up &#34;Port forwarding&#34; to route traffic coming to your router for this port to go to the internal IP address of your IP Camera.. The support section of the FOSCAM website has lots of information on how to do this. Once you have done this, you can use your IP Camera from anywhere in the word by browsing to http://ww.xx.yy.zz:#### where ww.xx.yy.zz is the IP address for your incoming house connection and #### the port number that you have chosen when you set up the camera and when you set up the port forwarding.<br /><br />This camera is for indoor use only and has worked very well for me.

Power cord could be longer but that's minor.  For the tech people out there, there is a way to use a hidden SSID.  You unhide your SSID, connect to the Wi-Fi network, set up a static IP or add the MAC address to your MAC filter(LAN and WLAN MAC are different), and then rehide the SSID.  Worked just fine for me and the static IP is a better option for natting the camera.  Im also a huge fan of the fact that you can turn off or on the night vision which is a great feature.

I don't think that you can purchase a surveillance camera that does all that this one reliably does for the price.<br /><br />I'm giving this only 4 stars because of the documentation. It could be better for sure. I found a couple videos on YouTube that basically showed me how to get it up and running (settings, port forwarding, email/text notifications, Third Party DDNS, etc).<br /><br />So far, it does as advertised. It has reliable motion detection but I am not seeing that it records a steady video stream to your computer or DVR. It can record short video clips (if you use IE for your browser) but you have to leave the application up and running to do so. Not too useful in my case. So if you need or want a video recording, you would likely want a different camera system.<br /><br />One last thing.... the camera requires power so there has to be an outlet close by to plug it into.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy. I can view the feed from any computer or from my Android app at any time. I get texts and emails with multiple pictures when motion is detected... and no monthly fees from a monitoring company.

At that point it was just a matter of kicking back and listening to Andrew explain each of the steps as he executed them on my screen. Andrew tested the camera and showed me the web address for logging into the camera. He was kind enough to type up a notes page with that information along with instructions on setting up my iPhone after installing the app and put it on my desktop. Andrew was also so helpful as to open this page for my review which he asked that I include his name. So here I am and this will deserve a follow up because..

I have spent the equivalent of days trying every possible option without success. I have read every discussion I could find online and they are full of complaints about this problem. I've found a few (very few) detailed suggestions on what to do but they involve playing around with router settings and other technically sophisticated steps. I've tried all that I felt comfortable with without success. It's also noticeable that the company itself is not participating in these threads, so what you see is request after request for help and no practical advice in response. I don't think I've ever encountered a product where so many people have the same problem and nobody seems to be able to fix it. What makes it so frustrating is that wired set-up is so easy and the camera woks as advertised. I can even see the camera being recognized by my router but when I disconnect the ethernet cable nothing happens.

US,51100965,R2KY2EJCUZHDVF,Foscam FI8910W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with IR-Cut Filter for True Color Images - 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67° Viewing Angle) NEWEST MODEL,Camera,5,0,0,N,Y,Easy to use and works great!,"I'll start by saying if you are looking for hand holding and slick looking software interfaces then perhaps you should look elsewhere. But if you want an inexpensive solution that works, is easy to install if you have at least a little bit of tech saavy, and provides a fantastic web cam experience that offers TOP NOTCH infrared night viewing along with complete remote control of side to side and up and down panning, then this is the camera to get!<br /><br />The software that comes with the camera is no frills, granted, but it allows you to do what you need to do to get it setup. Setup was no more than connecting the camera to my router via an ethernet cable, running the software on my computer which found the camera immediately, configuring the camera as needed,  then disconnecting the camera from the router, and it ran wirelessly no problem. I could access it internally on my network via Web browser and via their FREE Android app. I eventually paid $4 for an app called \\""IP Cam\\"" which works fantastic with this cam and allowed me to setup my tablets around the house as additional nanny cams. So lots of viewing options.<br /><br />You have to know a little bit about how to configure your router to enable viewing from outside of your network, but since FosCam doesn't TRY to make things idiot proof (like other cam solutions that fail miserably) there is no lame interface to fight through to get what you need done, done.  I was able to set up port forwarding on my router to my cams, and Viola!  Access from anywhere protected by non-standard port allocation (choose a port number, don't go with the default),  user name, and password.<br /><br />Now I'm viewing my cam from literally anywhere (even on my phone while driving I can have the cam on and hear everything that goes on).<br /><br />Their tech is quick to respond as well, and answered my questions to the point and accurately.<br /><br />Here is a list of reasons why I like this cam:<br />1) The Night Vision is OUTSTANDING! Literally clear as day, in pitch black.<br />2) FosCam had a free app for our phones allowing us to view the camera from as many monitors as needed.<br />3) There is a paid app ($4) from a third party developer out there that give you all kinds of functionality not available in the free app that we purchased.<br />4) We have the viewing app on Multiple Devices, allowing me, the wife, and the nanny to view the cam at the same time from different locales in the house. Have it on a tablet too, and can view from the computer.<br />5) The app supports MANY cams so you can purchase as many as you need and view them all at the same time. We have two to monitor the play area and the sleep area.<br />6) If you have a little networking know-how you can set up the cam to be viewable (safely and securely) from outside the home. Both me and the wife check in on our tots while we are at work.<br />7) The paid app has a background monitoring feature so that you can continue to monitor the baby with Audio as you do other things on your phone, or just sleep with the phone near the bed and the screen off.<br />8) The app alerts you with a sound of your choosing when your little one starts moving around, giving you a little advance notice of the pending AWAKENING!<br />9) Two way audio.<br /><br />And most all of these features are also available via a web browser if needed.<br /><br />Setting the camera up on the local network is a breeze.  Setting it up for safe secure viewing outside of the home takes a little bit more know-how, but is obviously very doable.  And there are directions, and good support. You can also assign different passwords for different people so that you can always revoke access at anytime, for any specific viewer (such as if you need to fire a nanny).<br /><br />The BIGGEST advantage is that you can use any smartphone, tablet, or computer as your viewing device and they can ALL be used at the same time.<br /><br />Very happy with this purchase.",29-05-2013

I have never had any big issues that took any real amount of troubleshooting. For $70 a camera, I have found real value in these models. That is until the last camera that I purchased.<br /><br />I have these perched in my window sills, so there is a bit of reflection from the white camera, and I noticed that it was alot less with the black model so I bit.  The last month I have went through the RMA process with Foscam and after hours of troubleshooting finally a return of the camera back to Amazon.<br /><br />I hope this review will help others in similar situation.  The value in these cameras (for me) was the ability for them to do Wireless N and WPA2 Encryption. Both the product page and the box packaging advertise both of these features. For the first 2 white cameras, they did indeed support them, but for the last black camera, I was having major issues getting the thing up and working properly.<br /><br />That is when Foscam Support informed me that there were 2 versions of the camera being sold, with 2 different Hardware Architectures supporting 2 different Firmwares.  The older of the two not supporting wireless N or WPA2 encryption.<br /><br />To check this, if you look on the bottom of the camera, there should be 2 stickers with MAC ID's. The smaller sticker is for the wireless. If it is VNT it is the older wireless G hardware. If it is FR it is the newer wireless N.<br /><br />This might not be an important feature for some, but for me I would have to run my network in G wireless mode which would effectively bring the speed down for all my wirelss clients.<br /><br />The bottom line is that Foscam should not be selling old Hardware as the Newer stuff.  Was this a one time mistake or is this widespread is my question.  I hope my experience is the exception and not the norm.  Check those stickers.",28-05-2013

The audio is terrible and there is significant lag (Running on a separate N wireless network) between real time and the video playback.  I would say it is 95% stable and you have to worry about the camera being operable since it can and does crash or lose connection from time to time.  I use the internet connection using the service that the MFG recommends.  It is easy to set up and works well.  Again significant lag and that affects the controls and the operating the camera.  This can cause the camera to lose connection and this is where most of my issues have been.  The audio over the internet is worse than terrible due to the lag.<br /><br />The video quality is decent I would not call it excellent quality.  You can tell that it is better than my baby video monitor.<br /><br />I would buy this item again for a security camera or monitor but not a baby monitor for a baby under two.

Before he hung up on me, he told me that if I still had problems (duh--he didn't actually fix anything in the 3 minutes he talked to me), I could file a request for RMA from the website.  I've done that, and now I'm waiting.<br /><br />The product failed in the first week out of the box.  The tech support is not only worthless but rude.  I would never buy anything from foscom again.

On the strength of that, I recently purchased a 3 pack, that also came with the (surprisingly large) 9 dB antennas.  The new cameras (using either antenna) would not work in network conditions that the old camera found acceptable.  To make a long debugging story short, I put one of the new cameras adjacent to the old camera and called Foscam support.  They did a reasonable job of remote debugging, including copying the setup parameters from the working camera to the new camera, but had to admit defeat.  (Both of my tech support calls were promptly handled by competent personnel, but were problematic for connection quality: background noise in one case, combined with pronounced Indian accent in another.)  My opinion is that this batch of FI8910W's had some manufacturing defect. Interestingly, when packing to return the cameras, I found my old camera's box was a millimeter or so larger than the new ones.<br /><br />For the geeks among you, the problem was associated with network bandwidth, but not in a simple way.  The new cameras worked OK when deep inside the house, but would fail when put on a windowsill.  It was not simply signal strength, since my Airport Utility would be reporting \\""Excellent\\"" signal strength for the connection to the camera.  I even purchased an Airport Express device to extend the network, and, while within a few feet of that device, the camera would work OK away from the window yet fail when on the sill.  To explain what I mean by \\""failure\\"", if after a reboot of the camera, it was put in a lateral pan mode from the web browser interface, it would cease showing video before it had completed the lateral scan, and would subsequently reboot itself.  These symptoms were not as prominent if the camera was put in QVGA mode (320x240) or the low-light IR exposure mode was in force. The old camera would work OK in all these conditions.",20-05-2013

It can't stream to a remote server, and it can't store images.  If you're going to record, you need a computer to just sit around and do that.  Five years ago, I always had a computer up and online, but now I only use my laptop -- which is sometimes online and sometimes not.  All the solutions I've found have been slightly impractical.<br /><br />However, as far as the camera goes, it's great.  I can get to it from anywhere, from any device, and I can watch what's going on in my home in real time -- even if the lights are off.  It's very convenient for watching our detached garage and it's a nice peace of mind when the alarm company contacts us -- we can quickly see if it's a false alarm or if there are people in our home.  The resolution is fantastic for a camera of this price, and it's got a good range of motion.  The night vision works pretty well, though you can tell it's in use as the lights around the camera faintly glow red even though they're supposed to be invisible.<br /><br />It's not weatherproof either, but it seems to work just fine outdoors provided you don't keep it in direct rain or where it might get submerged.<br /><br />Setup was easy, wireless range is very good, I really have no complaints about this device.",15-05-2013

After the initial screening questions the suggestions were do not use an extension cord, its is not an outdoor camera (true, it is not built for outdoor weather, but the web browser tool does have an 'outdoor' setting for viewing outdoors), your router must broadcast its SSID, and this will work only on wireless.  After this, Calvin took control of my system, changed my router to broadcast SSID and the camera worked.  He was helpful and courteous.  He was a pleasure to work with. He even took my browser to Amazon so I could do a feedback.<br /><br />The reason the SSID change fixed the problem was that it was getting dark and the IR cut filter no longer was being invoked and the camera was not re-booting.<br /><br />What finally fixed the problem was I simply rotated the lense 1/8 of a turn.  This must have loosened something (perhaps the mechanical IR cut filter) and the camera started working fine.<br /><br />I am now very pleased with its function, clarity and for keeping watch for critters in my garden the vivid colors are very helpful.  This camera is much better for viewing outdoors than prior Foscam camers without the IR cut filters.",14-05-2013

My experience has been a like/hate for the last 3 days.<br /><br />First, the camera is not exactly tiny, so discreet it does not do. But I knew that going in. The camera itself functions nicely. It does all the pan and tilt, but like other reviews say, it does not zoom. The IR also works well. So all in all the camera operates well except for one issue. Once a day it will reset itself and return to the 'center', what it considers its starting point. If you want it to always point to one place make sure it's the center.<br /><br />Now the real issue. The software is the worst piece of garbage ever created. I could go into detail but I would be writing a small book. Save yourself some aggravation. Toss it immediately. Find other software that works with the camera. I tried Vitamin D. It works ok, but had issues. First, it does not control pan/tilt. It would lose connection on a 10-15 minute basis. This would create many mp4 files. For some reason the software would create 8-10 processes that I would have to kill. I also had problems panning the camera with the Foscam software. The camera would pan or tilt so far, then freeze. If I hit center fast enough it would move and I could try to re-adjust. Otherwise it would go thru a reboot and go back to center a few minutes later.<br /><br />I then tried WabCamXP 5 which worked great. It does control pan and tilt. I had no issues with the camera freezing when moving. It never lost connect and I ended up with one large avi which is what I wanted. Only thing I missed from Vitamin D was the feature that detects movement so you can go right to that point in the video. Since I was recording constant motion it was not an issue.<br /><br />So in summary the camera works fine. Your mission will be to find the right software to use with it. If you are looking for an easy install and use this will leave you pulling your hair out.",10-05-2013

This camera was an easy set up. I used Foscam's remote setup service to get me wireless from anywhere in the world on my 3G smart phone and wi-fi laptop. It has worked perfectly since day one. It sits in a front window, rotates, captures a crystal clear picture of the front of my house (daylight only) and inside the house with infrared night vision beautifully. Today I decided to change the password on my home's wireless router to something easier to remember than the original 25 character behemoth.

Often I use the two-way audio to give them commands.  The original setup was not that difficult if you follow the instructions.  On my network it has a static IP and port mapping allows me to make it available over the Internet.<br /><br />The night vision works well, but does tend to see-through certain thin clothing.  This isn't a big issue, but it is worth noting that it may not be appropriate in some use cases.  During the day the color tends to falter leaving it a little washed out.<br /><br />My experience is that at 12 feet in darkness you can no longer distinguish between objects 1-2 inches in size.  To frame this, if you put a $1 bill on the floor next to a $20 bill you would struggle to identify which is which.  At 20 feet in darkness you will lose edge definition on items.  Anything beyond tends to reach the limit of the infrared range.<br /><br />In bright light you will add a couple of feet to each of the measures above.  The reason for mentioning this is that you may not want to locate the camera in a ceiling where it is inherently 10-12 feet away from any relevant objects.  Also, the camera as pictured with the product has the base pointed down.  To gain the most range of freedom you will want to mount the camera upside-down and flip the rotational axis.  This is supported in the software.<br /><br />The video recording features do not appear to work on my firmware.  The snapshot features require you to login before they work.  I had planned to have the stills grabbed every couple of minutes available to the public and the pan/tilt adjustments requiring a password.  To get around this I had to setup a PHP script to authenticate and store the images on a server.  Then people can access the images without logging in.<br /><br />The audio quality of the microphone is reasonable.  The speaker on the camera is poor and I highly recommend that when mounting the camera you add a set of powered speakers available on Amazon for cheap.<br /><br />The only downside is that there is an upper limit on concurrent viewers on the camera.  After five concurrent viewers the camera tends to become non-responsive to commands through the GUI.  The second camera of the same model with the newer firmware does not have this same issue.  Regardless, I highly recommend this camera and have recommended it to friends.<br /><br />When it finally goes up to 1080p or 720p my goal is to upgrade these units.",09-05-2013

There is software for configuring your camera and a web interface to allow you to view a live stream, but you'll have to use third-party software if you want to record the camera streams or view multiple cameras at once.",06-05-2013

Enable wireless access, disconnect the wired connection, look in your router/modem's setup and there's another address (&#34;Y&#34;). This is the one you need to use if you plan to access these things remotely via their wireless interface.<br /><br />You may be saying &#34;Well, duh,&#34; but everything that you attach to your network shows up in the router/modem's setup and in my case there was no information provided that let me determine which address belonged to which device, so I didn't notice the change/new address at first.<br /><br />Bottom line is that it would be best to write down all the addresses shown in your router/modem's setup and, as you add each camera, write down the new address that appears when you attach it wired, and then the new address that shows up when you switch it to wireless access. This last address is the one you will use when you open the ports on your modem/router to allow remote access.<br /><br />I recall reading complaints about the noise that the camera makes when it turns on the IR LEDs, and it does, indeed, click quite loudly. When I first started using mine, it would automatically turn on the IR when the sun set, which is not what I wanted (mine are looking out windows for daytime monitoring, and the IR just bounces off the glass and blinds the camera), but once I started using the Android version of IP Cam Viewer by Robert Chou and manually shut off the IR, they now stay off. Cool.<br /><br />Resolution isn't great, but it seems most IP video cameras are 640x480 (unless you're willing to spend a lot more money). Still good enough to monitor the condition of my lawn whileI'm on vacation.",04-05-2013

The first one worked great and was easy to set up,  until I accidentally dropped it and the power plug snapped.  I tried to repair that myself, but got frustrated and just bought a 2nd one.  That's when I *really* got frustrated, because the new camera wouldn't connect to my wifi.  I'm very technically savvy, and spent hours troubleshooting but could not get it to work.  I decided to return it and when the replacement camera came, I had the same issue again.  I don't think it's &#34;user error&#34;... it seems to me like the wifi radios are hit-and-miss with these cameras.  If you get a good one and can get it on your wifi, paired with good software, this camera can be pretty great.

Have it email you when it detects motion, or have 2-way conversations from your iPad, iPhone, or PC. Excellent iPad app allows full control. Pan, tilt, but no zoom. Remote zoom and focus would make this perfect. Night vision works great. Keep an eye on your place when you're out of town. Get emails if there's motion when you don't expect there to be. Browser controls vary with the browser. IE will give you the most versatility, but FireFox and Chrome also work, with varying degrees of success. The iPad app is the best.  Intuitive controls and speakerphone.

While it would be nice to have a little higher resolution, the image is quite good.  The infrared works impressively well in total darkness and has a good range.  No problems at all connecting with ethernet cable.  If you don't need wireless and want to only use an ethernet cable, for the price this would be a four-star.<br /><br />Now the bad:  I returned it.  I am computer saavy and despite spending about three hours trying to get it to recognize/connect with  my Airport Extreme I could not, even after following the outstanding step-by-step instructions at this website (while it is for a slightly different model should have worked for this camera):<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />This website is essential, because the manual is useless.  However, despite how well written the website instructions are, I repeated them three times, and again could not connect.  Even if it had worked, the setup is so cumbersome, detailed, and so full of pitfalls that it is frustrating and time-consuming.  Also, you have to be extremely comfortable changing IP addresses, gateway addresses, subnet masks, etc. to even attempt setting this camera up for wireless. I didn't even attempt to learn more advanced setups that are theoretically possible for this camera.  The overall software is so-so.<br /><br />Related to the above, as mentioned the manual is awful: lacking detail, poorly written and poorly translated and of little help.  Whoever wrote the above website instructions should be hired by Foscam.  There has just got to be a simpler, more straightforward way to hook this up to wireless.",02-05-2013

If you're using IE be sure to read the manual concerning browser security and ActiveX security problems with this FOSCAM. If you use wireless MAC filtering, look on the back of the camera for the MAC address, it has BOTH the Ethernet and wireless addresses on it. For motion-detected video, it will mean the camera(s) will be streaming constantly over your network, so your bandwidth will be limited for any other use. If you're using Blue Iris software, in essence a pc application which functions as a DVR (better than the included software), the same applies-you're basically monitoring a non-stop stream of video for motion detection. All this streaming really loads up your home/business network.<br /><br />All the above references video. For picture taking, the 8910W will NOT save to an on-board sd card, but WILL email you or upload (ftp) to an internet server of your choice (not video.)<br /><br />My suggestion to you is to bite the bullet and get the FI9821W, which in essence, is a mini-DVR/pc/camera in one. It will monitor and record to an SD card on the camera(not included), and (once set up) can be operated completely independent of any pc (if you choose.)<br /><br />One last thing-the USERNAMES as well as the passwords are CASE SENSITIVE in Blue Iris (PC and mobile.)",29-04-2013

To the point of being unusable. Another issue I have is with the horrible quality of the documentation. As others have noted, it's as if it was either written by a non-native English speaker, or translated poorly. I also hate the web interface and the fact that it doesn't offer an SSL login option so all your credentials are sent in clear text over the network.

US,14923150,R1GPJXROZ444NW,Foscam FI8910W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with IR-Cut Filter for True Color Images - 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67° Viewing Angle) NEWEST MODEL,Camera,3,0,0,N,Y,Definitely worth the money.,"Pros:  This is a very inexpensive, high quality camera.  The night vision and auto-light adjustments are great.  It responds to controls well.  It's attractive, non-descript, and works the way it's supposed to work with no hiccups.  I followed the instructions (though they were rather complicated) and it worked on the first try.  While it took me over an hour to set up (and I am a very confident computer user) I didn't hit any frustrating points, nor did I feel compelled to call tech support--this is a HUGE plus for me.<br /><br />Cons:  The problem is that viewing away from home is a difficult set-up that, in most home environments, requires the use of a program on a computer that IS RUNNING the entire time you want to be able to view the camera.  So, if I want to leave home and be able to check in on the camera, I have to leave my computer AT HOME, ON, and RUNNING A THIRD PARTY PROGRAM.  This is frustrating.  Also, it's virtually impossible to get the sound to work unless you use additional equipment (i.e. speakers).  There is no iPhone or Android app, it's just a mobile website that loads slowly and works slowly.<br /><br />My Use:  I'm monitoring my dog's activity in her crate while I'm out of the house.  It works well for that, though I can't take advantage of the auditory features to hear if she's crying or to talk to her to calm her down.  I can see if she needs me home to change her food/water/wee wee pad or if she's freaking out.  The night vision works REALLY well - I can see her moving around even when I only have a lamp on in the house while I'm away.<br /><br />Conclusion:  If sound doesn't matter to you and you're looking for a high-quality video home monitoring system, this is the cheapest way to go that will still work well.  I would love to have a native app for the camera and I'd love for it to have an easier set-up.  (That said, the directions were thorough and relatively easy to follow if you have any sort of idea of what you're doing.)",25-04-2013

My research showed that the EasyN was either a clone or somewhat generic version of a Foscam device, so when the Foscam FI8910W went on sale I got one, thinking I was buying a better device -- after all, the SALE price for the Foscam is higher than the REGULAR price for the EasyN...<br /><br />The Foscam has the ability to turn the IR emitters on and off, both automatically, and/or on demand.  The EasyN is superior in EVERY OTHER WAY.<br /><br />Both cameras offer 640x480 images, but the Foscam image looks like something 1/4 that size that was digitally zoomed and makes the somewhat blurry EasyN image look like crystal clear HD in comparison.<br /><br />The Foscam's camera housing is only loosely connected to the base -- it will wobble relative to the base.  The EasyN is solidly constructed.<br /><br />Both are easy to use and their browser interfaces are almost identical, so nothing special there.<br /><br />All-in-all, I think I paid an extra $20 (an extra $35 at regular price) for the IR Cut Filter and a name.  The trade-off in image quality for the IR Cut is absolutely not worth it.",24-04-2013

We set this up in the nursery using this mount ([[ASIN:B00B5A33YO Pedco Ultra Clamp Assembly 360 Swivel Mount for Cameras and Optic Devices]]) to attach it directly to the side of the crib.  We use an old iPhone as the dedicated screen.  I downloaded and paid for an app called \\""FoscamPro\\"" that utilizes all the features of the camera, such as two way audio.<br /><br />The set-up features of the app allow you to access the camera over the LAN, which facilitates much faster operation, less delay, and higher update rates.  It also works over the internet using your IP address (but you have to be able to set up port forwarding).  One nice feature is that the camera comes with its own dedicated URL valid for 3 years, which means you don't need to have a static IP.<br /><br />I've played around with some of the other features, like motion detection, email notification, and uploading directly to FTP.  I set up my Windows Home Server with an FTP client, and played with the settings in the camera until I got it to upload files directly to a directory on the home server.<br /><br />So far, this camera has worked exactly as advertised and was totally worth the money.

They are simple to setup, if you know what you're doing.  I can't stress that enough.  If you aren't familiar with computers, networking, etc...  You aren't going to have much fun setting this camera up.  That being said, if you do know what you're doing, this camera can be up in running with at least just basic viewing within minutes.  I can't speak much to the features of the camera such as the FTP and email alerts and so on.  I have both of these cameras feeding into a server running Blue Iris software.  So have I haven't really explored any of the additional features.  So far they the original one has been up without issue for a few months now.  Both of mine are running over wifi and the video quality is just fine.  The pan and tilt functionality seems to work just fine.  I am pretty impressed with how well you can see in pitch black rooms with this camera.  Unfortunately, I don't know exactly what the effective distance of night time viewing is because the bedrooms I have these setup in are only about 12-15 feet at their longest but I have no issues seeing the entire room with them.<br /><br />For those who are under the impression that you get a free ddns account with one of these cameras, you technically do.  The DDNS service is bound to the actual device.  It's labeled right on the box that it's bound to the individual camera, and the DDNS URL is right on the bottom.  That doesn't mean that you can go to a 3rd party companies website and expect them to give you free DDNS service they otherwise charge for.<br /><br />Overall for the money I'm pretty happy with my purchase.  I wish they had zoom functionality, but I understand that would come with a higher price tag.  I do appreciate the fact that these are actually 802.11n, just wish they supported 5ghz.  2.4ghz can get awful crowded real quick, and in my experience 5ghz isn't very common.",23-04-2013

There are free iPhone apps that allow you to watch the camera from anywhere.  You can't hear sound or record from the app, but for a monitoring perspective, it does the job.  Additionally, AwkwardHamster on YouTube has step-by-step on how to set up your camera to view from any computer, as well as goes into some free video recording software.<br /><br />I haven't mounted the camera yet, but the pan aspect lets me capture both my living room and sitting room.  I bought my camera from Warehouse Deals, so I don't know if it is supposed to look more yellow than normal, but I don't mind it.  The video comes out crystal clear on my iPhone 5 and I can now watch my LO wherever I go!  Great for the travelling man/woman.<br /><br />I will update once I get the video recording option set up.  I think it would be great for security, as well as a baby monitor!  I wish I would have bought this instead of my AngelCare, as we barely use that anymore.  I can imagine I will use this camera for the rest of my son's life.  Recommend based on functionality, wireless capability, and PRICE!",22-04-2013

As long as you are comfortable with changing setting on your router getting these cameras setup with port forwarding was very easy and works very well.  The cameras have MUCH better low light non-IR ability than the two other cameras I have used (d-link and axis) and with the IR lights turned on the image is very good in my opinion.  While there may be better quality cameras available as far as the image is concerned, the price on those cameras is much higher and streaming that higher quality is difficult over the net for most home users.<br /><br />I really like the ability to move the camera around remotely.  While the built in microphone and speaker aren't the best they do work.  All-in-all I find that for the money this camera is hard to beat and I would buy another if needed.  I can also recommend using tinyCam Monitor Pro for viewing and controlling these cameras on your phone.  The program works great and can control all of the camera functions.",21-04-2013

Unless you have some basic networking knowledge you may need some help with setting this up. There are many settings to configure in your router, camera, and possibly modem. This is not a simple plug and play. I have to say that the two times I called customer support I was promptly connected to a technical support person. They set up a remote link to your pc and they configure all of the settings and will get the camera up and running. The camera has a built in mic and speaker for remote monitoring and communication. The picture is good in daylight and at night. Don't expect a high def picture. Just a good quality which is all I need. I set up the motion detection which works very well. Setting up the unit to send e-mails was a little tricky because I could not find all of the settings for my Yahoo account. For reference the setting for yahoo and sbcglobal.net are smtp.mail.yahoo.com port # is 465 select TLS from drop down menu. Check the box under the TLS menu as well. There are also several you tube videos with detailed set up instructions. There is a good gmail one from the manufacturer. I also purchased the Foscam pro app from the App Store for my ipad and iphone. I highly recommend this app. It works great and was easy to set up. I tried some of the free apps but could not get it to work. The app lets you change some settings on the cam remotely.

They were up and runnning in no time. To access them remotely requires some basic port forwarding.

I did have a problem with the port forwarding having never done it before. After many google attempts to get it right I called Tech support and they walked me through it. Used the camera for many months, no problems and good quality images. I have this mounted inside on a window ledge and did have to put up a black sheet to prevent window glare back when the sun is shining directly at the window (which is only from about 2-4pm for me) I have a huge tree in the yard, so shade is my friend in this case.<br />Remote viewing is great too, especially when you're not home. Love the features and easy to use.<br /><br />On 4-15-13 I had to get a new router which didn't recognize the camera. I did everything I thought I was supposed to such as adding the new router password codes, etc...the camera did work when plugged into the Ethernet, just not wirelessly, again contacted tech support and Ron Jacob fixed what was wrong. My IR went out after 3 months of use, wasn't a big deal to me since I have motion lights in the yard. I did mention it to Ron Jacob and he said to watch it for a few days since we had to reboot the camera itself and that should fix the IR problem. No clue why the IR went out in the first place, working fine one night, then not....I was told that if the IR didn't work a replacement would be sent out. Overall, very happy with the camera, great images, even the night ones (when the IR works) the price is great for what you get and the customer service can't be beat!

Everything worked like it was supposed to and I didn't have any problems removing the CAT5 and making it Wi-Fi, just be sure you give it a few seconds.  The WebUI was fine and had the basic controls you'd expect: up/down, left/right, diagonal. It even had a flip/invert image in case you mount the camera upside-down.  In terms of a security system, this product is only half of what you need.  It would be fine if you are constantly looking at the camera and are there to point it in the right direction when needed, but the automation and recording features are not as accessible as the other features.  In fact, for full recording functionality additional software is recommended.  I understand that the software is not bundled because you might only need 1 copy of the software but 12 cameras - bundling would be redundant.  Lastly, I tried messing with the mic/sound on the camera but that was a bit frustrating as it required a VLC plugin and even then I never got the speaker option to work, however, that was not a feature I wanted so I'm not too worried about it.  The picture quality of the camera would not be featured in the Iron Man movie but features and clothing are identifiable.<br /><br />TL;DR: Great camera but you need additional software to record the video",16-04-2013

She was patient and knowledgeable as she took charge of my computer and explained everything she was doing and explained even more than I could understand. Without hesitation not only corrected my problem (which by the way was a combination of camera setup and incorrect settings on my wireless router) would not let me leave until we tried ever possible use of the cameras making sure they worked properly.

Mine does not work after following the instructions to the best of my ability -- given the 1 hour I was willing to commit to the undertaking.<br />Admittedly, I did not contact customer support -- I don't want to have to.  I did not get enthusiastic about sleuthing-out the myriad potential reasons for its inability to function.

I especially like the fact that I can control the camera with either my iPhone or iPad. Overall I have been very satisfied with the camera and its featuers. The setup is a bit technical, and I still have not been able to get the camera to transmit the feed when not connected to the same wireless network, but I assume that is due more to a lack of time on my part than the camera's fault.<br />One thing I do have to mention however is how horrible Foscam customer service has been. As stated, I initially bought this camera as a baby monitor and security camera for my daughter. As she has gotten older it has become more viable to mount the camera up on the wall so as to get better coverage of her room so that I can check on her when she's playing. To my surprise, when i went back to mount the camera with the included mounting bracket, I find out that the included mount did not securely fasten the camera to the wall mount, which allows the camera to rotate freely on the horizontal axis. This makes the wall mount virtually unusable. If I wanted to mount the camera on a vertical wall, the camera swings around freely so that the heaviest part of the camera is closet to the ground, thus making the camera's Pan and Tilt functions useless.<br />After going to Foscams website I realize that the mount they included with the camera works ONLY with the FI8918W cameras, and does not seem to fit the FI8910W. Further evidence can be found on Foscam's website in that if you buy a 2-camera bundle of the FI8910W cameras, the bundle includes a completely different wall mount than the one that came with the camera I bought, which shows that they have obviously already found, and corrected this problem with new purchases. Thinking of course that this should be an easy fix, I emailed Foscam to notify them of the problem with the included mount, in hopes that I could geta replacement sent out that would work with my camera.<br />Here is the emailed reply:<br /><br />we can send you a new standard wall mount.<br /><br />you will have to pay for the universal mounting bracket.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />XXXXXXXX.<br /><br />Abysmal customer service.<br /><br />Camera - 4.5 stars; Customer service - 0 stars.",09-04-2013

The product seems well built, the instructions are clear, and the web-based software is pretty straightforward and easy to understand.  The camera worked right out of the box with the typical configuration required for a device of this type. It works well from an iPhone or iPad without special software.  The manual focus ring is hard to adjust because the IR LEDs are right where you want your fingers to go - you need to move the focus ring using the face of the ring.  If you intend to use the IR night vision capability looking out a window or through a window screen, be aware that the IR light will likely reflect off those items making it difficult to see beyond.",09-04-2013

VERY good in low light except that the relay for the IR lights makes an annoyingly loud CLICK when it turns on or off, so around dusk I'll hear the camera click several times. Don't understand why this isn't a solid state switch instead of a relay.<br /><br />No DVR software comes with it, although they will sell you one from their website. HOWEVER instead I downloaded a free open source DVR app called iSpy Connect which was recommended in another review here.<br /><br />iSpy Connect was a little finicky to setup with the FOSCAM camera. If you use the default settings that the iSpy Connect wizard sets up for you, the framerate is horrible (less than 1 FPS). After digging through the forums what I found was that you need to use the optional VLC plugin as the video source (I think you need to have VLC installed, and I already had it installed as it's my primary media player app). Using the VLC plugin I'm now getting an average of 15 - 20 FPS. All I did was copy the URL from the FFMPG source tab and pasted it into VLC plugin tab as the source URL.<br /><br />iSpy Connect has the ability to record based on sound levels or motion detection.

It works well remotely (I use it to check in on an elderly parent in another state). I would rate it a 5 except for the this problem.<br /><br />There is a security issue.  The camera has two modes; and ActiveX mode for viewing with Internet Explorer, and a Server Push mode for viewing with other browsers.  This security issue only affects the Server Push mode.  The problem is, often when I have logged in once, it stops asking for passwords on subsequent logins.  For example, this morning I logged in from home, and it asked me for the password.  Later in the day I logged in from work and it did not ask for a password.  I have the camera on a timer switch so that it powers down and restarts every morning, which clears the credentials.  This doesn't happen every time, so there may be some caching going on.<br /><br />This could be a problem if you log in as an administrator, then someone else stumbles across the URL and has full access to change passwords, etc.<br /><br />There is no logout button in the interface, so if this does happen to you, you need to reboot the camera, which is available through the interface (although that seems a little heavy handed).<br /><br />I have posted this concern to the Foscam forum as well.",03-04-2013

Works EXCELLENT.<br /><br />The reason you might want to choose port 88, is that some internet service providers will block port 80 incoming to your account (to prevent web servers from running on a non-commercial account).<br /><br />It's a good idea to set a fixed IP on the camera, and reserve that IP on the router, so that whenever your camera reboots and your DHCP IP lease expires, you might end up getting a whole new different IP and you might end up with connectivity issues. I believe with uPnP you don't have this issue, but I'd rather do it the static IP address way, it'll be more reliable.<br /><br />Up and running in about 20 minutes. Indoor video is good enough quality, and I was impressed at how good quality the IR night vision is. Highly recommended and very satisfied. Pan and tilt speed are even adjustable! No zoom though, but it's fine. I love the motion detection that emails you snapshots when it detects movement.<br /><br />Was able to access the camera from the internet using the FoscamPro app on my iPad and iPhone.

First I found it very difficult to set up, had to watch a youtube video several times to get my router settings correct. Still only works sporadically on my home LAN and I haven't gotten it to work at all from my android phone using the Foscam App except when connected to my home Wifi. Even then it will work for a few hours and then just take off and start moving through its axis and comes to a stop centered horizontally and looking at the ceiling. Sometimes it just won't connect through my browser, just times out. The only way I've found to get is back is to reboot my main computer. Also the youtube videos show setup on  3rd party free severs that may not be free anymore so I set mine up on the Foscam server that is free for a limited time. Not a big  deal as I can't get it to work on any of them. Most of these problems are probably due to my lack of networking knowledge and if I put in more effort could probably be resolved, but I prefer things to setup and work out of the box. On the positive side It has a very good picture, excellent night vision range and the motion or sound activated capture with email alerts works great.",02-04-2013

That would not be the first time for this type of camera. It is my third of the type. I think my first was a Foscam knockoff. It's still in use at my vacation cottage and it outside under a protective overhang. It did not work well inside because the lights made seeing through a window at night impossible. The second was an earlier model Foscam. After 8 months of use, it ceased to by accessible from the Internet. But it still sends me email messages from the cottage when the motion detector spots something.<br /><br />A bit of previous experience made this product only mildly annoying in the setup. I already had the camera tool on the computer. So I didn't bother with whatever was on the CD. So I hooked it to the Ethernet cable and had it operating wirelessly in about 2 minutes. Then I changed the port to 425 and put that in the router upnp setup. No luck adding 425 to my IP address for getting Internet access. But after messing around with the device management settings, I found what I needed under \\""Upnp settings.\\"" I clicked on the box for \\""Using upnp to Map Port.\\"" And voila. I could access the camera from the Internet.<br /><br />The view is nice and sharp. But problems come up whenever I pan. I lose connections with the camera and have to connect again. Sometimes that is easy. Other times not. Not something I need to put up with and not something I will mention to the notorious Foscam customer support. Unless someone quickly tells me about a quick fix, the camera will go back to Amazon for an exchange.<br /><br />At my cottage, I have a couple Panasonic network cameras. They have all sorts of bells and whistles. Zoom, microphones and speakers. But when they crash, they can only be reset by sticking a pin the the little reset hole. I have access to the cottage network via Logmein and was able to reset the Foscam knockoff from afar. But not the Panasonic cameras. I could not getthem going remotely following a crash caused by my ISP changing the IP address.<br /><br />This latest purchase is for keeping an eye on things at my principal residence. I could do that with this camera, but there is no reason to put up with the flaws. Back to Amazon for an exchange unless someone tells me about a miracle cure for the flaws.<br /><br />UPDATE: The camera went through a few hours of operating without crashes. But then it was back to crashes whenever I made it pan. So I have returned it. An exchange for a non defective model was not possible because the camera does not come directly from Amazon. But I have ordered a new one.<br /><br />FURTHER UPDATE: The replacement came fast and it worked fine. I now have three of these. So setup has become almost routine. But sometimes setting up for Internet access can take a bit of time. I sometimes go through several port setting in the camera and the router before getting a port that will work. Ports in the low 400s seem to work best. Why some don't work is a mystery to me.",01-04-2013

They are very easy to access and use because they are IP cameras, but the software they provide is 100% browser based and lacks in functionality... ESPECIALLY if you don't run it in Internet explorer. If you attempt to access the camera in Chrome you will not be able to record to a file on the local machine, and will not have several other options available to you. Also there is no standalone software which means if you want to record you will be paying for a third party software, writing your own, or trying to remember to keep IE on and logged into the cameras.<br /><br />The cameras I received were constantly rebooting so I had to send them back. I replaced them with 2 8910's from a another seller and while they work ok, they are not perfect...<br /><br />Another thing to note these may be wireless but YOU STILL MUST PLUG THE POWER IN. The real problem with this is the cable they supply is a \\""wall wart\\"" and is about 4 or 5 feet long. Meaning wherever you want to install this better have an outlet. Because these cameras run on 5 watts and 2.5 amps you cannot power them on the stock adapters if you attempt to run a line to them through a ceiling unless you are willing to run a real power line and install an outlet. You are not getting more than about ten feet of extension via splicing.<br /><br />If I had this to do over again I'd have either paid for wired cameras (since I need to wire them anyway) or paid an extra 20-30$ for POE ready cameras.<br /><br />One nice thing to mention is there is some programmatic access to the controls via CGI so if you are a programmer you can have some fun with these.",27-03-2013

But I spent the last few days trying to figure out the reason I could not get the camera to work via wi-fi. After searching numerous posts in various foscam forums, I happened upon a quote someone snagged from the foscam.com site (and my apologies...I closed iExplorer prior to the thought of copying and pasting the quote for posting a review) stating something to the affect that \\""that foscam 'now' guarantees that only FI8910W purchased directly from foscam.com will work with 802.11N\\"". The discussion in the forum is that 'now' seems to be the operative word. That said, if you're looking to use the Foscam FI8910W via a wireless connection, you might want to explore other options.<br /><br />Admittedly, it begs the question re Foscam's corporate integrity. Regardless of the seller, if the brand was built and advertised to be a wireless device, Foscam should be willing to make nice on legitimate purchases from legitimate sellers such as Amazon.<br /><br />Aside from returning the item, I contacted Amazon and spoke to a representative to apprise them of the \\""non-wireless\\"" issue that makes the advertisement not so truthful.",26-03-2013

It puts out an ok image at 640.  To me, at 640, it has a rather sluggish frame rate.  In the world of tech we live in, I would expect better.  This is likely why this camera isn't a HD item.  If they can't get 640 frame rates very high, then HD would be unusable.  I found some of the setup to be a bit tedious; however, that is because using IE would cause the camera software to hang up the entire computer.  Once setup, it works good.  User note: there is no need to use the hosting sites to see images on your portable devices (iphone, android phone, ipad, etc).  Just give the camera a static ip, use port forwarding on your router and then point your camera software to your external IP and voila; your done.<br /><br />In summary, I am happy enough with this, but had a bit higher expectations.  I would prefer better frame rates and higher resolution.  Smoother movement and better app that didn't lock up on 64 bit OS / IE.  This would be a better value at about 60% of the cost.<br /><br />I probably buy another and would still recommend.  But it could be a whole lot better.",25-03-2013

Also you can remotely turn to into another angles that you want to see in the house  It has  features that it can take photos or videos,   I can set it to the motion sensitive note that whenever it detects motion or movement it will notify me through my cell phone/ email. It is a very good product to monitor babysitters or teenagers at home or even burglars breaking into your house.

It comes short of what I needed.<br /><br />I turned on motion capture/alert.  When it gets dark, the photoresistor on the unit activates the IR for night mode.  When this happens, it triggers a false alert.  So basically, you are guaranteed 2 alerts every day, 1 at dawn and 1 at dusk.  This is extremely annoying.  There is no software fix for this, as Foscam wired the photoresistor completely independent of the programming logic, so this is really a hardware bug.<br /><br />My fix for this was to put tape over the photoresistor, this is the only way around this.<br /><br />If Foscam could fix this feature for me, I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />The user interface is a little user unfriendly, and leaves something to be desired.

I bought 24V Wall Plug power over ethernet which are on amazon for $9 and then i got WS-POE-5v (dont buy from amazon, its cheaper from the manufacturer) which split the poe back to a lan cable and barrel connector for power.

The camera worked well but about 2 months in the IR lights would constantly flicker on and off regardless of the room lighting. This is where the disappointment begins. I thought no problem because Amazon is an authorized re-seller of the Foscam cameras.  It is now about 1 month since I sent my camera back to Foscam for replacement and I'm still waiting. Foscam required that I pay shipping both ways to get the replacement. I can understand paying to send it back but I was surprised when the billed me $7 to send a replacement.

I've had two of these camera's in place for just over a year now and have been very happy with them. I use them at my home with one covering the front entrance and the second one covering the rear porch/yard area. Both camera's perform well for both day and night operation. Unlike older model camera's, these have an infrared filter that moves into place when it gets dark. Daytime operation is full color while night time operation is black & white only, which is normal for any infrared type camera system. Video is a standard MPEG4 with embedded audio capability if desired. This model can be used either CAT-5 wired or wireless operation using 802.11g with all current encryption methods. It is NOT \\""n\\"" capable but obviously will work on an \\""n\\"" router if the router is set to allow such connections. Can be a pain to set up initially but once set up it works great. One thing I've notice about both camera's is they reset at random times for no apparent reason. They come with a 5-volt \\""wall wart\\"" style DC power supply that usually requires the use of an extension cord because the power supply cable is rather short. Some have suggested the use of an extension cable causes random reboots because of a drop in the 5-volts required for proper operation. However, only one of my two camera's use an extension cord, yet both have this random reboot issue just the same. Have never figured out why they do this so I just live with it, as a full reboot takes about 45 seconds before the camera returns to the predefined position you set up in advance. For me it's not a major issue but for some it might be, as it could occur just when you need video evidence the most!<br /><br />Recently there was a newer model (FI9820W) that came out which offers 720p HD video, H.264 compression and an incorporated SD slot (not sure if it's standard SD, mini or micro) for on-board storage if desired and I believe 802.11n wireless capable instead of g-only wireless. I'm thinking about upgrading to this model but I understand through that particular model's reviews it has it's own set of issues as well. I guess \\""we'll see\\"" :)<br /><br />If I had to buy this camera over again I'd do it again I think because for what it is it's still a decent camera for the price, and now it's even cheaper than it was a year ago when I purchased mine so they're an even better deal now :)<br /><br />Please comment if you've got any questions about this camera and I'll be happy to get back to you, as I'll receive an email anytime someone comments here.",14-03-2013

I've been wanting to upgrade to a more modern and reliable system for a while. The other day we were in Target and happened to come across this Foscam FI8910W on clearance for half off. Yup, I was shocked too. It was a store return, but we couldn't pass up the deal. Maybe someone got it for Xmas and didn't know what to do with it cuz nothing looked like it had even been removed from the box. This great bargain got us thinking about getting another one, and that's when we ran across this newly upgraded model, the [[ASIN:B008OYAL26 Foscam FI8916W with a Better Housing and the Newest Model]]<br /><br />The biggest difference between the 2 is the new housing; it's sleeker and has a ball and socket lens atop a swooped arm.  Other than that, the basic footprint is the same to this model.  The entire swooped arm rotates during pan, and just the ball on top tilts.  It's actually pretty cool.  Other than that, it seems to be exactly the same as this older tried and true model.<br /><br />Paint it Yellow and You Got a Minion<br /><br />This Foscam FI8910W looks like a one-eyed minion from the movie [[ASIN:B003UL4GOW Despicable Me -- Deluxe Plush Minion]].  It's cute and I like the shape and look of it. It's cool, but the new model is cooler.<br /><br />Velvety Feel<br /><br />Really like the matte finish, and nice rubberized kinda texture feels really great to the touch. Makes the cam look and feel like a top notch, quality product.<br /><br />Easy Setup<br /><br />I've read some of the problems others have had setting this up, but all went smooth as silk for me.  I used the included setup disk and just went step by step, barely glancing at the instructions.  If you have any experience setting up WiFi devices, then you'll have no problem with this. If you've never done anything like this before, then it's a good time to learn. It's basically just an SSID and password, and a user interface accessed via an IP address and your favorite web browser. I was up and running and viewing my cam within 10 minutes on my Win 7 laptops.<br /><br />Compatible Browsers<br /><br />I don't use iE for anything, so no words of wisdom there. But for me, the included software seems to play nicer with Firefox than Chrome. But overall, both worked fine for me. I'm considering the Foscam Blue Iris Pro. Seems like it might be worthwhile. I downloaded the 15 day trial and am still playing with it.<br /><br />Mounting Bracket<br /><br />Nice touch! Just mount with a couple screws, and a hand-twist camera mount screw. Screws and anchors are included, but I used my own self-drilling screws; much easier to work with and more secure.<br /><br />Port Forwarding<br /><br />I have a pretty tight firewall, so I had to setup some custom ports and forwarding rules. Again, if you have experience with it, no biggie; if not, it's only a couple paragraphs of reading and you'll be up to speed.<br /><br />Wireless Simplicity<br /><br />Once the initial setup is done via a wired connection, just enter the setup menu and input your SSID and password, and you're set for wireless. This is where this cam excels over Logitech Wilife. No electrical wiring network communication = no time delays or surge protector interference. Definitely getting more of these Foscam's over time and fazing out this old Wilife crap!<br /><br />Pan & Tilt<br /><br />Like budduh! No more blind spots! Sure, I have my fave happy place for the angles, but love the option of pan & tilt. Especially handy to get that perfect viewing angle, but also very nice to have the mobility if I want it. Commands from the software to camera are very snappy and on the dot. Precise, responsive and a huge convenience and security enhancement.<br /><br />Auto Pan<br /><br />Setup a motion path for the lens to follow. Very nice way to expand and automate the viewable coverage area.<br /><br />Easy-Peasy Smartphone Integration<br /><br />Watchyour cams on your cell phone and tablet. I actually prefer connecting via a remote viewing app, like Splashtop or TeamViewer. It's just easier, but you do need to have an accessible computer on site. Otherwise, just connect to these cams directly via the Foscam app. Worked well on my Android tab.<br /><br />Bottom Line -- this is a really nice security cam setup. I think I'll upgrade our whole system and just add more of these cams over time. Easy to use. Nice image quality. Pan and tilt. Decent price. I'm partial to the newer model's design, but still like this one and glad to have gotten such a great half-off deal on it at Target.  Happy! ;oDyour cams on your cell phone and tablet.

NO AUDIO!,"I got this camera for basic monitoring of my home.  It was easy to setup, so even the most novice of computer users could do it.  The hardest part was reading the poorly translated English directions in the manual.  I downloaded the free IP Cam Lite app on my smart phone and was able to access the camera anywhere.  I was so impressed with this camera, I purchased another one.  While I waited for the second camera to arrive, I downloaded the $3.99 IP Cam Pro app on my smart phone, since the free Lite app version didn't include audio.  I tested the audio and right away I knew there was an issue.  I was able to listen, but I could not use the microphone.  The speaker on the cam is so distorted and at a low level, that I thought I must have a defected camera!  That is when I did some research, and discovered this camera is known for audio issues and Foscam is aware of the problem.  Their solution?  They will ship you a repair kit and instructions, in which you must open up the camera, switch the wires and then solder them together!!  But don't worry, Foscam support is only a phone call away....are you kidding me??!!  They are selling a defective camera and falsely advertising the audio features this camera obviously is incapable of producing. They need to stop selling this as a \\""two way audio\\"" camera.

Repeat days of phone tag with tech support (they call back HOURS or the next day after you wait at least a half an hour to get to their answering service that speaks very poor english) only to be told the camera is faulty, and to return them.<br /><br />ALSO.. most of these raving reviews you're seeing?  Foscam tech support takes control of your computer to fix the cameras.  Then when they have fixed them, they bring you here, and WILL NOT let you off the phone until you write a review, WITH THEM STILL IN CONTROL OF YOUR COMPUTER.  It is almost like having someone hold a gun to your head and tell you to write a review.  It is borderline cyber bullying in my humble opinion.  I mean hey, if you're not tech savvy and need help installing these cameras, and you have someone who IS tech savvy in full control of your computer, how likely are you going to be to write a bad review with them watching?  I, personally, wondered what they would do while in control of my computer at that point, so i terminated the team viewer and hung up on the tech person rather than be forced to write a raving review I DID NOT MEAN.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you're not an expert in port forwarding and networking, steer clear.  If you plan on putting these cameras up somewhere that it is difficult to get to them to fix them, remove them, replace them, etc.  STEER CLEAR.  The features of the camera are awesome..

The key thing to remember is price here. You get what you pay for, but I felt this camera does more for the price. I have used it for 3 months and no issues so far. The video quality is obviously not the best out there, but purely as a cheap monitoring device it delivers. The pan and tilt works well, and with the installed camera pro app on android, you can control it remotely. The night vision capabilities are average. From what I have read somewhere, security of this camera is a cause of concern. Apparently, the camera can be easily hacked into. Dont have any hard evidence, but if you would like to use it as a supporting system that you turn on and off, it shouldnt be a huge concern.<br /><br />Very few cons I can think of<br />1. Security of this camera is average<br />2. The video feed can be stuttering or not fluid. Must be a problem of the camera or the wifi speeds causing it.

The camera was very easy to set up. I have not used the provided software, but did it manually.<br /><br />The picture quality is good, 2-way audio works well.<br /><br />DDNS works very well. Remember, you will still need to configure your home network to allow connections from outside, if it is desired.<br /><br />It allows for you to add 10 users and control their access. Nice!<br /><br />Here are the reasons why I gave only 4 stars:<br /><br />1) 2-way audio uses the VLC plugin on non-internet explorer (IE) browsers. I could not get it to work on Mac, Linux, Windows using Firefox or Chrome. It ****works awesome**** using activex on IE. The other option is to use VLC and you can hear the audio but obviously you cannot talk back. They should have used some other plugin to provide two way audio.<br />2) The manufacturer has some control issues I think. To even download firmware updates, we have to provide them with email address, validate the email address and then they will send firmware download links by email. The email did not contain links to the latest firmware, actually the page had older version than the firmware that came with the camera.

This window has been the source of two burglaries and we want to have evidence if we get another break-in. The pluses for the FI8910W is a good feature set, easy to set-up, a nice alarm feature that sends emails when motion is detected.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are two negatives that result in our rating of two starts. The biggest issue is the photo's are too blurry to recognize anyone. For the motion it has detected so far, its been my daughter who uses the den a lot. While I know it is her, there is no way from the photo's the FI8910W sends to us that we could recognize her. The faces in the photo are way to blurry. We have the unit set to the maximum 640X480 mode and to be fair, perhaps at this resolution any camera will not allow faces to be displayed. But we did expect more out of the unit,<br /><br />The seond negative is once a day, the unit changes position and points at the ceiling. This makes the motion detection and photo's useless. We can log in to the unit and go to a preset to get it positioned correctly, but not something we want to do daily.<br /><br />If you are lookign for a security camera, would suggest you look elsewhere. Find one with a better camera resolution which will allow for positive identification.",05-03-2013

Initially, I was researching the Logitech Security Camera system due to their easy setup & convenience. However, Logitech cameras cost a lot more, and the homeplug feature seemed too bulky. As I did further research via amazon reviews, there were customer reports that Logitech cameras failed within 2 years of usage and there were also hidden fees for remote access! Logitech also prevents backwards compatibility, so newer models can result in new software rendering your existing Logitech security system obsolete. The Logitech was both pricey & not reliable, so I continued the search for something more affordable which led to the Foscam. Most of the negative reviews regarding the Foscam are due to the wireless LAN setup, it took me about 3 days to understand and setup the camera because I had no prior experience regarding port routing, DNS, etc.<br /><br />I would definitely look up on youtube and search \\""awkward hamster foscam\\"" view the tutorials 1) basic setup 2)how to access camera via android,web, etc. After viewing this tutorial, you will figure out whether or not you are ready to meet this challenge.

The camera reliablity responds to pan and/or tilt commands and the connection to my Linksys E1000 router is extremely reliable.

On day two, I convinced him to call Foscam tech support and they were able to help him. He was just a few small settings off of making it work on his own but, as you know, a few small settings can kill a tech project in no time. Foscam support was of no help to us in 2011 but it was totally different this time around.  We are not dummies when it comes to computers, we set up our own home network and have wireless printers, etc.  It is just the nit picky settings that will get you.  I would recommend this camera.

The feature set for the software is also great but...<br /><br />The WiFi radio is bad.  It worked for about 2 days and then stopped working.  I had to spend a lot of time trying to configure it and nothing worked. It would connect to my network sporadically then it stopped connecting all together.  Their service department was unable to help me.<br /><br />There is a big delay between the time it detects motion and the time it takes the picture.  I had the camera pointing at the entrance door in a fairly standard sized living room and each time somebody would enter, the camera would send me an email with meaningless pictures.  The person managed to enter and get out of the frame almost each time.<br /><br />The browser viewing page regularly display a dialog saying that it lost the connection to the camera and stopping the picture both when the camera was wired and wireless.  Dismissing the dialog would start the streaming just fine but it does require user input and, if you don't realize the dialog is up, you are basically not listening/viewing the area.  This makes it useless as a baby monitor because if you keep it on the background waiting to ear noise you will be missing the action.<br /><br />Sadly I had to return the camera.

If you have never messed with wireless cameras and such before, it takes a little effort to get started. Foscam has a pretty decent website with videos to help walk you through it. My opinion is  that they have gotten better and more helpful over time. They also put out firmware updates and appear to address issues that users have had.<br /><br />The user interface isn't great, but it isn't bad either. It will work with Android although it behaves and functions a bit differently. I have experienced the occassional difficulty connecting to a camera, that usually sorts itself out after repeated attempts. But I will also say that I've seen that kind of thing with a Linksys at more than 3 times the price and I think the video is better with the Foscam.<br /><br />I know some people have had some issues, but I'll just add that there are a number of things you can do wrong. It pays to watch their videos before trying to set one up. The oldest one I have, I've had for quite awhile, and it still works fine. I have since bought more.<br /><br />These are pretty nice cameras for the money and they have some nice features. If you are a novice with this sort of thing, take your time and follow the directions and I'd recommend watching their videos first.

We put it at our cottage to check the weather and see any people or traffic going by. Since it rotates 300 degrees we can scan inside as well. We placed it in the front window.<br /><br />You don't need a PC after initial setup. Only a wireless router that the camera can use.<br /><br />Setup took about two hours but that includes everything to the point I could view it and control it from my iphone over the internet. Setup is not for a novice. But if you've ever set up a router and a wireless network at home you can handle this task. There are some excellent videos on YouTube that made the setup process easy. From box to viewing on my LAN took 10 minutes. Setting up wireless operation another 10. Getting it to work on the internet and then my phone took about a half hour of configuring and playing.....all with the help of the YouTube videos. Last I set up email motion settings which emails you one or a series of photos if motion is detected. This took about an hour of playing with the settings. Motion sensitivity is adjustable 1 to 10 from a leaf blowing across the snow on setting 2 to where it takes a delivery truck driving by on setting 9 to set it off.<br /><br />The infrared is nice. Our cottage is black dark at night but we can see the whole room fine even the objects 25-30 feet away. However if the camera is rotated toward the window with the IR lights on, you just see glare reflected back so the IR must be turned off to view the street at night. Simple toggle on/off switch.<br /><br />Notes on internet use:<br />1. You must have a host domain setup through a domain service. There are free ones. I used DynDns. This is the \\""website\\"" that your camera resides on. Again, refer to the YouTube videos. They talked me through it.<br /><br />2. The settings can be changed from hundreds of miles away over the internet once setup is complete. You can assign multiple usernames and passwords, at least 6, for administrators (full control and change settings), operators (view, pan and tilt control) or visitors who can only view without control. Very Nice feature.<br /><br />3. Only Internet Explorer supports multiple cameras. If you use Firefox or Safari you can only view one camera. Two or more cameras on your system would simply require opening Firefox twice, no big deal. I like Firefox better.<br /><br />Summary: High quality and excellent functionality! I am buying a second camera for my cottage rear window so we can watch the deer and wildlife while not there. And to see if anyone is snooping around. The camera will email me photos. The FI8910W is highly recommended.<br /><br />Update April 14, 2013. Loved it so much I added a second identical unit. After 6 weeks they are both running flawless. I can see what's going on at my cottage 200 miles away. I have them in the windows so I can pan and tilt to see inside or out. Daytime color and contrast is very nice. Night vision works great too. I take a peek every morning. I still love and recommend this camera! I really like the motion detection alarm that emails me snapshots of people and vehicles going by. Sensitivity is adjustable so I don't get everything that moves, just people on the front yard or porch. Also I highly recommend checking the setting \\""email ip address\\"". Should your dynamic ip change, you can't access your camera. But the camera will email you the new ip address within a few minutes and you can redirect your URL to view remotely. My ip has changes twice already and this saved the day!",21-02-2013

All the parts I would need for a set-up were included......it even had an Ethernet wire on a small cleverly designed reel.  I followed the directions exactly.  (The directions could have used a little better English, but getting the idea is not difficult.)  INSTALL the software!!<br /><br />The installation went without a hitch.  The camera came to life.  I created a password, left the username as 'admin', then unplugged the Ethernet wire and pushed the reset button underneath the camera and then the reset button on my Linksys router and within a minute all was good; camera and router had 'shaken hands' and agreed to work with each other.<br /><br />To access the camera on WiFi, you have to know your computer IP address, which is easy to obtain from your router.  If you don't have any other cameras, the default port is 80.  Using a browser: type in to the address your computers IP address followed by the camera port number  XX.XXX.XX.XX:80  and the camera comes up with pan and tilt features, among others.<br /><br />This is the easiest camera I have set up.<br /><br />I DO NOT work for FOSCAM......I don't even know where their headquarters is.

As other users have said setup can be challenging. It took me a week to figure out, but now it is working smoothly. I have set up motion detect alarm, e-mail setup, dns set up (really not needed, but I will explain later), port forwarding and iphone app set up. I was disappointed initally because the set up cd came broken. However, I was able to download the application from foscam website. Once the software is loaded and the camera is connected to the PC, the IP address for the camera will pop-up. Please note the IP number. I think most users get confused with the IP numbers. For a typical home with a router, there will be a Router that assigns a LAN IP number, most likely 198.168.1.1. Once the camera is connected the IP address for the camera will pop 198.168.1.3 (in my case). The last number after the dot will be different for each device connected to the LAN. Keep in mind you cannot access the camera from the outside using this IP address. For that you need to find your WAN IP address. You can use the site whatsmyip.com and search for your WAN address. In my case it was 68.199.xx.xxx. This WAN IP address is important if you want to connect to your camera from the internet. Don't be fooled when you are able to connect within your wifi using the 198.168.. IP address. You are within the network and will be able to connect easily. Typing the camera's IP address (198.168.1.3 in my case)you can access the camera's set up menu. In User setting, you can change the login name and password from the default provided by foscam. You can create administrator and visitor privileges also. Please set the image recording path. Keep in mind recording will take place only if the PC or an USB external drive is always on. In Basic Network setting, enter the IP address. For me 198.168.1.3, Subnet mask 255.255.255.0 could be the same for all (otherwise check the router administration page). Gateway & DNS server is the IP address of router 198.168.1.1. I have read lot of issues in using port 80, so enter a new port. I used 5656. If you have a Netgear router provided by Optimum online. You can enter the routers IP address on main address bar and a login page will pop up. For optimum online the login name is admin and password is optimum. Sorry for going off track. In the Wireless LAN settings, enter your wireless ID and password. If you press the scan button it will display your network also. You can skip the other menu option. If you want to access your camera with a domain name like [...] instead of[...]<br /> you will need to set a DNS host/redirect. You can get a free DNS redirect option at[...] The problem with free account is you will have to renew by email every month. I think paid option is $20 for a year. I have set up a free account. In the camera's DDNS settings menu, you will have to enter the details of your DDNS Service, user name and password used to access the service and the domain you have with the provider. In mail service the sender and receiver will be your e-mail address. For yahoo, the SMTP server will be smtp.mail.yahoo.com and port is 465. For your mail provider you can find the details of the server and port by doing an internet search. SMTP user and pasword will by e-mail address before the @ and the password. This mail service is to send you e-mail with attachment of the photos when a motion detect alarm is triggered. Please check the boxes, you don't have to test it now. in the Alarm Service settings menu, check all the boxes and keep sensitivity at 5. Duration to record as 60 secs or less. You can select the time for the motion detect to work and hit submit. Basically the camera set-up is over. Now go to your router administration page as explained earlier. Make sure your camera shows up in the devices connected menu. Remember camera is connecting wirelessly, no need to connect with ethernet cable after the initial set up is over. In the Port Forwarding menu add the camera with its IP address (198.162.1.3 for me). Enter starting and ending port at 5656. While setting up domain name in noip.org use the WAN address (68.199.xx.xxx) with port 5656 to point to the domain name. It might take a few minutes to register. Now you can access your camera either by your domain name [...]or [...] from inside and outside of your network. The[...]can only be used to access within the wifi network. I also used a free iphone app CamViewer and entered the domain name to see the camera from outside the network. You can test the app and domain name by turning off the wifi in your phone.

Scheduling alarm is very easy by selecting days an hours for the camera motion detection. It sends me a set of photos to my email whenever motion is detected on the scheduled time. I can access the camera via my Galaxy S III phone, Galaxy Note 10.1 and from my desktop PC. The pan and tilt response of the camera is great. The video and photo resolution is very good including at night with IR vision. I bought a Samsung DVR and 4 cameras set for like $599.00 that I returned, because poor resolution, difficult setup and it was wired. With the Foscam, I record video from my office. I receive a photo of my kids when they arrive from school, I can monitor my home whenever I get a false alarm activation.

If you're planning to purchase one to see how well it works before getting additional devices, I'd suggest just getting all of them. I'll be purchasing two more along with the Blue Iris software.<br /><br />I got this camera to watch my dog. I have a rescue dog that's very timid and loves to pee in my house ONLY whenever I'm not looking. I never catch her in the act. So I picked up one of these cameras to give it a try.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ Image quality is acceptable. HD would be nicer but I seriously don't need it.<br />+ Sound goes both ways. You can enable the mic and listen to audio on the camera side, plus speak in the mic on your side to project the audio to the camera side.<br />+ Night vision works very well.<br />+ WiFi support.<br />+ Can be setup to be accessed from anywhere with various levels of access (admin, operator, visitor).<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Enabling audio introduces a 3 seconds delay between when the event occurred and when you see it.<br />- Setup was more difficult than it needed to be.<br />- No DVR feature out of box.<br /><br />OTHER:<br />+ I bought the iPad app and that works great.<br />+ It supports alerts. I've used the motion detection through the iPad app, but haven't tried the face detection since I only care about motion.<br /><br />The setup instructions are simple... provided that you don't run into any issues. I connected the antenna, network cable, and power. The device moved and then stopped. On my Win 7 PC I installed the IP Camera Tool, launched it and saw Anonymous and a message about the subnet being different. Double clicking the name showed a dialog window where almost every label were question signs. I ended up reading further in the manual and found the similar looking dialog window with the correct labels. Matching up the position of the controls, I set a static IP address and a different port number, accepted the changes, and stop the IP Camera Tool. After a minute I launched the IP Camera Tool and saw the camera listed as expected. I then accessed my router and forward the port to the IP address for the camera, and was able to access it remotely.<br /><br />The things that annoyed me was the dialog window having only question signs (??????) for all of the labels. What kind of software bug was that? Was it not localized properly? The labels resolved themselves only after I figured out and entered the values. Furthermore, despite connecting the camera to my router, I still do not see the camera listed as being connected via a wired connection (all other devices are displayed). Other than that, the router configuration was simple since I've done this type of setup many times.<br /><br />Now that I know what to expect from this camera, I'll be getting two more.",18-02-2013

Apparently these reviewer simply put the Camera up and let it run. If you start to customize the device, soon you'll notice that the WebUI (Web User Interface the camera has a built in Website for viewing the cam image and configuration) seems to update your changed settings, but in reality did absolutely nothing that would make me think that it did. The alarm motion trigger setup is a nightmare, aside the fact that it doesn't update to the new settings, but you think it did. (meaning no error feedback)<br />A friend of mine owns the same model and one night we been ripping our hair (what hair?) out trying to set his up so it would only send a text message to his phone. Bad luck, whatever he configured, it would rapidly send 6 images along, even though it unchecked that option. This is bad, bad, bad since his Phone provider would bounce it back to the sender. The result, absolutely nothing. Well, sometimes at the pleasing of the Camera it would sneak through, but very unreliably. In my own case I don't need to have an alarm sent to a cell phone. So I went to check out how my motion trigger would perform. I am still working on figuring out what the heck happened. I would trigger the motion sensor, stand there for about 60 seconds and then go back to see if e-mail was sent properly. If the e-mail makes it, I see a series of images, but none has me in the picture.<br />I have a relatively fancy home network with public access to my web servers and e-mail server. This works fine for my everyday use and I have visitor coming from all over the world, although not millions but hundreds every week. I believe I know a little bit about the principle of networking.<br />The Camera / Web UI / Firmware has tough me otherwise because I have no idea what it does and what not. To make things a little worse, it may do it at random. Whoever programmed the Firmware / WebUI should go back to doing something easier.<br /><br />Edit:<br />The review above is primarily about the build in web UI and not about the camera itself.

The step by step instructions from a previous reviewer \\""R. Tickle\\"" were extremely helpful. I did have a few issues that I needed to sort out however. I use a Linksys WRT54G wireless router with HyperWRT firmware. Setting the static IP for the camera was tricky. I tried using the Gateway and DNS that was being reported in my router configuration screen and that gave me an \\""illegal parameter\\"" error message in the camera configuration. Turns out I needed to use the typical http address I use to log into my router i.e. [...] for the gateway and DNS server. Changing the port from 80 (which is a public port that everyone uses) to one of the ports that Foscam recommends caused me to lose connection with the camera. Initially, I thought I did something wrong in the configuration and I kept resetting the camera. In fact, if you lose connection, you did it correctly. You are no longer connecting to the camera through port 80 (duh). I reconnected to the camera by typing in the static IP address I assigned to the camera followed by the port i.e. [...]=new port number you assigned to the camera. I also had a small issue with wireless connectivity. I use a MAC filter on my router. The camera had two stickers on the bottom with two different MAC addresses. I used the one I thought to be the correct one. Turns out it was the other one. Port forwarding on a Linksys is pretty straightforward so there were no issues there. Once configured, the camera works great. I use a web browser to connect to the camera from my work computer or iPhone. The picture quality is really good. The IR works well. Sound quality is OK but not great. There's a bit of lag when talking into a mic and hearing it on the other end. Not a show stopper though. Overall, I'm very pleased with this camera.

Tim picked up and had my camera up and running on the local and wireless networks pretty quickly.  I was glad that tech support used remote assistance software, \\""Team Viewer\\"", so I could watch the troubleshooting steps.  Although, I did hesitate to let a remote user having access to my computer, but I guess the benefit of cool technology was worth the risk.  I think Tim could have been a little more vocal during the troubleshooting, but customer service at most companies has been trained to only provide solutions, not talk customers through the process, so I can't blame him.  I guess providing solutions is good for a significant number of customers, but I feel like I am pretty technical and like to be involved in troubleshooting.  On second thought, it is nice for a change to have someone else do the troubleshooting for me.  Otherwise, he was friendly and extremely professional, and I expect the rest of tech support would be trained in all the same manners I described above.  Overall, a likable experience.",14-02-2013

Itried to set them up myself and after 2 weekends of dealing with my internet provider, I gave up and sent them back.  I then called Foscam directly because i really needed these cameras to work.  I ended up re-purchasing the 4 cameras theough Foscam for about $100.00 per camera but these cameras came with unlimited tech support.  Once Foscam tech support started working on my cameras they immediately realized I had a bad router.  That information could have saved me two whole weekend of working on this.  In about 4 hours tey had all 4 cameras up and running and also helped my wife setit up on her I phone.  That was 2 years ago. Last week we moved into a new home and brought our 4 Foscam cameras with us.  I figured I would call Fascam and they would nt remember us but I was wrong. They took my name and set an appointment for Jeez to call us back at 4pm and he did (twice)!  I could not beleive how patient and how much time they spent with us.  It took them about 4 hours total to set it all up.  During the call my wife even commented \\""I can't beleive they are apending so much time on us\\"" and that is when I decided to give them a great review (something I rarely do).  On a scale of 1-10 I am about a 5 when it comes to technology and I would recommend that anyone considering these cameras to seriously consider thier tech support.

It was relatively easy to setup, although the IP scanner tool included on the software CD doesn't seem to work with Windows 7. I had to get the IP address from my router's DHCP client list. Aside from that, setup was pretty easy and went according to the included instructions. Foscam's website has some pretty decent step by step instructions on topics such as port forwarding so you can view your camera via internet as well as on your local network.<br /><br />The power cord that comes with it is comically short for a device that is almost certainly going to be mounted high on a wall or from the ceiling. Thankfully, Foscam sells a 10' extension for \\""only\\"" $15.<br /><br />I can't figure out why they decided that the ring of LEDs around the lens should emit visible light. They are supposed to be IR LEDs but they are clearly visible. That could be just some of the light filtering through from the ridiculously bright LED status light on the back of the unit. Neither is so bright as to keep my daughter up so I guess it doesn't matter but it seems poorly thought out.<br /><br />The camera moves very quietly. I can't hear it at all, except through the application. It does make an audible click when switching to/from night vision.<br /><br />The mounting hardware was present and adequate.<br /><br />The camera's firmware offers a great degree of control.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this camera to friends.<br /><br />I'd also recommend the Tinycam Android ap if you want to view the camera on an Android mobile device. You can simply view it through a browser but the ap provides way more control and is more user friendly, I think.",12-02-2013

There were a few key features I was looking for. I wanted the ability to watch from my Android smartphone and from a computer, and I wanted it to connect to my network via WiFi. This camera has these features and a few extras that have come in handy. This camera seems to be very well built, it has already survived a couple of toddler induced incidents. I have the black version, which has almost like a satin rubber finish to it. I think this finish will help to prevent scratches, but time will be the test there.<br /><br />The setup of this camera requires a computer. You can use either Mac or PC for this, I used a Mac. For the initial setup, you need to plug the camera directly into your wireless router. Then you put the included CD in your computer and run the program to locate the IP of the camera. Once you have the IP address, the rest of the setup is done in your browser. This is where you'll join the camera to your wireless network. It was pretty straight-forward for me, but I can understand where some people could get confused. The language used in the setup is very technical and does not offer any explanation of the technical terms. There is plenty of help online if you have any questions about the technical terms and what they mean. I didn't have any problems throughout the setup and I had the camera up and running in about 10 minutes.<br /><br />There is no included Android/iOS app with this camera, but there are hundreds of IP Camera apps that work with it. My wife has been trying the iOS apps out on her iPad and has found there are lots to choose from. Same goes with my Android smartphone, there are literally hundreds of IP camera apps. The browser interface is not flashy, but definitely gets the job done. There is very little lag when viewing on any of my devices, I'd guess less than 1/2 second. I'm pretty impressed with this aspect, I thought it would be a couple seconds behind at a minimum.<br /><br />The night vision feature is incredible on this camera. It is important to note that the IR leds used for night vision will glow a soft visible red light, so it is easy to spot the camera in the dark. The night vision is so good, you'd swear there is a light on in the room. I have noticed that during the daytime, the night vision has trouble deciding when to turn on. But I don't really plan on using this during the daytime, so this does not concern me.<br /><br />The pan/tilt feature is something I didn't think I'd use, but I have used it to track my daughter's movements in her bedroom after converting her crib into a toddler bed. The pan/tilt motor is pretty quiet, but it is audible. The range of motion is very large, much more than I need for a little bedroom.<br /><br />There are a few features that I do not plan on using. You can set up email alerts when motion is detected, as well as upload images so you can see what triggered the motion. You can also record video from the camera to a DVR or FTP, which can also be triggered by motion. Since I'm not using this camera for security purposes, I don't really have any intention on using them. But I can definitely see where they could be useful in other applications.<br /><br />I've had this camera running for about a week and have had no problems so far. I am very pleased with this camera and I'm thinking of getting another to put in my garage for security purposes. If I had to find a fault with the camera, it would be that the web-browser interface is a little clunky and looks like a website from the late 90's. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for an IP camera that can be viewed on a smartphone, tablet, or computer. I can't imagine why anybody would spend more on a camera when this camera appears to have everything most people need.",12-02-2013

However the low pricetag on goldbox pushed me to give them another try.  I'm glad I did.  This camera from time to time goes on sale for just under $70.  First of all, the picture is what you'd expect from an IP camera.  While not HD it's quite good.  I watch my cats on my Android phone when I'm out and about.  Robert Chou produced a great Android app called IP Cam Viewer Pro.  Buy it, it's a smooth running app.  He has added just about any camera model you can imagine to the driver list.<br /><br />Pros of camera:<br />1)Nice quality video<br />2)Pans and tilts smoothly<br />3)Microphone actually works<br />4)Is fairly easy to setup if you have moderate networking skills<br />5)Wireless N (very nice feature for a low cost camera)<br />6)Excellent night vision (the feature that made me upgrade to new camera)<br />7)Range of motion is great<br /><br />Cons of camera:<br />1)From time to time it has a couple second loss of control.  Camera just goes unresponsive then comes right back like nothing was wrong. I run mine on wireless N network.  This is really my only gripe and why I took one star off.

I have read where some doubt the validity of customer service claims but I made this purchase on Amazon and even tried to get help from my router support (who's instructions supposedly bypassed the firewall or something yet still didn't work).<br />The reason I'm giving the camera only 3 stars is because the tilt/pan doesn't seem to be working as it did initially (I've had it less than a week).

I have four and while this particular one was a gift to a family member, I can attest that for the bang, this is the best camera on the market. Pan and tilt more than make up for the 640x480 picture resolution they provide. Plus, if you plan to monitor via a remote device like a cell phone, you don't want an HD video feed.<br /><br />I have also found that a lot of the complaints about these cameras are mostly \\""user\\"" caused.  Improper set up and use of the router are the number one causes of complaints.  How do I know this?  Because I was one of them that constantly complained about the camera.  Then, I decided to do some schooling on networking and found that most of my woes were self-inflicted because I wasn't \\""doing it right!\\"".<br /><br />While these are Wi-Fi cameras, I strongly recommend wiring them if they are going to be used for serious surveillance.  Main reason being is that there are so many things that can interfere with Wi-Fi and cause it to either fail or become very week.  The use of a microwave oven that is between the camera and your router is one of the main causes for camera \\""loss of signal\\"". Again the camera gets blamed when in actuality, it's physics to blame.  Florescent lights also interfere with Wi-Fi.  Many homes use these now to save on power.<br /><br />These are also indoor cameras but I am using two of them outside. So far, no problems.  I do have them in a place where they are not exposed to direct moisture. They are under an eave and in a carport.

Since I use the AT&T 2Wire router, I looked up port forwarding and found a video by a guy with profile wiseguy775 on youtube. Just like the guy explained the ip address of the cam should be forced 192.xxx.1.60, to be outside the range of the router which was .64 to .253<br />Then i was able to port forward, but it was not working for me. I used various ports like 777, 8060, 8070. None of these worked. Eventually one of my friend told me to use 19732 and somehow it worked for me. Didnt do anything different except a different port number and it worked great. So try this port, might work for you.<br /><br />I used youtube since I actually always do that first, though I have to say the CD was really easy to use, at least to get started.",09-02-2013

For those of you giving this cam a low rating because you failed to set it up wireless, DO SOME RESEARCH. While i am a computer tech, the overall setup was NOT hard for those who will take the time to READ the manual and/or RESEARCH on the internet. The manual, google & youtube are your friends.<br /><br />Also, someone mentioned you have to pay for services to be able to view your wireless cam externally (away from your home network, at work/mobile phone) this is NOT accurate. Once setup wirelessly, if done correctly you can view externally without paying as everything is handled through your wireless router...not sure what others are claiming about this.<br /><br />I've only had the cam for a few days, but i am very impressed with the overall quality...for less than $100 you can't beat it. I will most likely be picking up another for the other side of my house.

Until I started doing some research, I had no idea these cameras each encompassed a tiny computer and web server!  My mind was still back in the day when analog video went down a wire.<br /><br />I studied the reviews of this camera here on Amazon for a couple of hours, trying to figure out where most of the snags and pitfalls were, in advance of ordering.  For example, here is a handy tip from another user: \\""If you want to use the preset camera positions you MUST first uncheck the \\""disable preset\\"" box in the PTZ menu under Administrator.\\""  You could spend hours trying to figure out the 'presets' without that little tiny tip.  Thank you!  Once I compiled a list of things like that that were likely to go wrong, and fixes for them, I ordered two cameras.<br /><br />It took me a couple of hours to get two of these set up, with my bare-bones knowledge of IP's, routers, and networking.<br /><br />You have to take the setup step-by-step, and test between steps!  Don't try to do it all at once! Once you get one function working, proceed to the next level.  There is a lot of useful information written in straight English on the Foscam site, so I hardly looked at the manual.<br /><br />The little program they supply called 'IP Camera Tool' is incredibly useful in getting things set up.<br /><br />I did NOT use the CD.  I just downloaded the latest firmware from Foscam, and updated that on the cameras once they were hooked up (one at a time) thru the ethernet cable.  There are two parts to the firmware, a \\""System Firmware\\"" and a \\""Web UI\\"" firmware. Update both. My cameras were one version behind.<br /><br />I was able to get video through the ethernet cable in a couple of minutes.  I set mine up as fixed IP's so their IP addresses would be a different numerical series than computers, but you don't have to do that if you don't know how.  Wireless setup was easy; once you set the IP, enable wireless, and reboot (the camera), you should pull the ethernet (NOT the power) cable.  The cam should then communicate by wireless after a minute or so.  Once the wireless was working, it was easy to set the motion alarm.  Once I got the motion alarm going, I had the system start emailing images to me (had the camera trained on a busy suburban street).  In order to test the email settings, you have to hit SUBMIT before you hit TEST, another little tip.  And when you see the mysterious words \\""Network Lamp,\\"" that particular function turns the blinking green network light on the back of the camera on and off.<br /><br />Pretty soon I was getting more email messages than I could stand, so I set up a FTP service to a website I own where I can store the pictures.<br /><br />If you use Internet Explorer you are home free, you can view an array of cameras with one login, and monitor sound, too.  I don't like Internet Explorer, I use Firefox, so right now I have to login to each camera for live viewing.  There are plenty of free or cheap monitoring solutions out there.  Last night I tested out iSpy which seems to do the job of monitoring multiple cameras for not so much dinero.  Once I get it all figured out, I will settle down on a permanent monitoring solution.  But at first, you will just monitor through your Internet Browser.<br /><br />Setting up port-forwarding for worldwide-internet-viewing was pretty darn easy considering how much jabber there is in these reviews about it (You need to use a proxy, or go to the coffee shop, to test port-forwarding...I couldn't get it to work until I logged in with a proxy...found that tip on Amazon, too!).<br /><br />Everything is crystal-clear, with no noise.  The night-vision will light up a large room.<br /><br />Seriously, if you have no concept of what an IP address is, or you don't know how to access your router (and you don't want to learn), you should avoid messing with these cameras.  If you just want to run these on your own local network, and you know a little, the complaints about difficult setup are way overstated.<br /><br />These cameras are an outstanding value, but research carefully to understand the limitations before you buy one.",08-02-2013

I needed to have a port forwarding service, which you know of if you've been reading these reviews. Without this service I could only observe my camera's feed through my home network and only on my home network.<br /><br />Do you need to pay for a subscription service? no! &#34;NO/IP&#34; has a free basic service with no special features that let me accomplish my requirements for a home IP camera. At first my connection wasn't working after the simple DDNS setup on NO/IP but that was my internet service provider blocking the connection through a firewall. I found online a PDF with instructions from my ISP giving me exact directions on how to allow the camera to operate freely on the network. I then typed the info from the instructions, rebooted the camera, and I WAS UP AND RUNNING.<br /><br />If connected to wifi, the new forwarding adress would not work, if not connected to wifi and running on 3G, the forwarding address WOULD work.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE, MORAL OF THE STORY, I had everything I needed completed in less then a few hours!. The initial camera set up, IN MINUTES!<br /><br />I was also able to set up my gmail account to send me an alert email if motion is detected on my camera, and was able to program which days and times to send out these alerts.<br /><br />The IR feature works great, and the pan and tilt works great too, only downside is no zoom feature which would have been a perfect addition.

As a facilities manger that works with high end SD and HD cameras on sophisticated software, I was well aware of the potential cost factor with a home video surveillance setup. Yet I trusted Amazon reviewers, all of them from 5 star to 1 star and made my evaluation. I took the chance.  I purchased one of the FI8910W cameras bundled with the Blue Iris software to give it a shot.  Here is what resulted from that initial purchase....  I have since (within a week) purchased two more of the FI8910W cameras and three of the FI8905W outdoor cameras because I was that satisfied! Yes, they are only standard definition, but they fit my budget and give me a substantial peace of mind while in town or out of town (with the Blue Iris software for PC and the app for iphone/iPad).  All I can add is that if you have a tiny bit of tech know how, you can set this up and feel a bit more comfortable knowing that you installed a really good working, reliable, and cost effective means of monitoring your home. I cant speak for the Foscam tech suppport because I have not had a need to utilize such, but I can say that I am incredibly pleased and saving pennies to try a HD Foscam camera.

If you're looking for something to monitor your home or business while you are away, this is a good option.    Pros:  - Price  - Ease of Set up  - Smart phone and tablet support  - Great night vision  - Capable of panning (looking left, right, up, down)    Cons:  - No zoom    It's essentially plug and play so it's very easy to set up.

My kitchen was pitch black at night but the feed was crystal clear.    AT&T Uverse EWIRE SET UP:    I have AT&T Universe at home so I had to figure out how to access my router and forward the port assigned to the camera so I could view the feed remotely via the internet or my iPhone.

From there you need to find the FIREWALL option and then click \\""pinholes and DMZ\\"". Step 1 says to select a computer and shows you a list of devices on the network. Find the ipcam and click it. On step 2, click \\""add a new user defined application\\"".  For an app name, just type \\""Foscam\\"".

Leave the other fields blank and click \\""add to list\\"" then click \\""back\\"".    The name \\""Foscam\\"" should now be viewable in the Application list. Select \\""Foscam\\"" and click the \\""add\\"" button. That should associate port 80 with the camera and allow access to the camera feed from outside of your home or business. Now click \\""Save\\"".    To test, just type your_cameras_name.[...] into a browser and you should get the login screen asking you to type the cameras user name and password.

I use tinycam Monitor Pro for Android and Foscam's app on the iPad.  Tinycam is better.  The camera pans quickly and has a huge range of movement. There is no optical zoom, but both the Android and iPad apps lets you pinch to zoom.  The 2-way audio does work but is not great.  Think bad-webcam audio.  Probably ok for monitoring but it would be torture to have a lengthy conversation.<br /><br />Look - If I owned a business I wouldn't buy a bunch of these and expect hi-def, facial recognizing security, but for putting a few of these up around the house while you're out to give you peace of mind or to monitor pets, I think they're perfect.  They do make a higher def version as well and if I see one of those on special I may spring for it.  A little crisper image would be nice and optical zoom would make this perfect.",04-02-2013

It is NOT plug & play. There are many configuration options. The software requires extensive knowledge of settings and the language that goes with knowing Wireless Routers, HTTP, FTP Servers, WEB Servers, IP configurations. The Quick Start Guide is somewhat of a tongue-in-cheek, poorly translated-to-english, not easy to follow version of an originally Asian/China written guide. Grammar, wording & sequencing are a bit odd. I have seen this many times before, so reading between the lines is necessary.  I have written & currently support multiple company web sites & maintain a Windows 2008 R2 network for a company of 35, so Im somewhat familiar with what it takes. If you want to record activity from installed cameras, logic says you need to move or copy those recordings &#34;off premises&#34; to be reviewed later. Why? Because if your property is being stolen or destroyed, so are the recordings if they are only being stored locally, on premises on a computer in the house or office. Its like any good backup. So an FTP off-site or &#34;cloud&#34; is necessary to protect your files. If your just using the cameras to monitor rooms, or family activity, they would be fine. Read and take your time or you will find yourself being overwhelmed by technology. You will find trial & error the norm.",03-02-2013
US,5819315,R1X76N53TH6AA9,Foscam FI8910W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with IR-Cut Filter for True Color Images - 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67° Viewing Angle) NEWEST MODEL,Camera,4,0,0,N,N,FOSCAM FI8910W REVIEW,"Last week I received a dual pack FOSCAM FI8910W's that I ordered through AMASON.<br /><br />The Foscam FI890W is a wireless (802.11 B/G/N) network camera that is packed with features normally<br />found in more expensive IP cameras.<br /><br />It has pan and tilt capabilities which means that instead of having a fixed view in one direction like<br />some of the other cameras, you can pan and tilt it so that you can see what you need within a 300 degree<br />range and 120 degree tilt angle.  Minor con here is there is no zoom feature, which would be nice to have,<br />but not a necessity. One other observation is that the motor drive is extremely smooth and quiet.<br /><br />Next, it has night vision provided by a dozen IR LEDs that provide up to 25 feet of night vision. I tried<br />this and it works quite well and is much better than several other cameras I have worked with in the past.<br />Camera placement is also a factor to consider especially if your neighbor has bright outside lights.<br /><br />It should be noted that the camera has a resolution of 640×480 which at first I considered a possible con.<br />But I found the picture quality quite good even in full screen mode. The camera appears to employ good<br />quality optics for this price range.<br /><br />The FI8910W also allows for motion detection, and is very simple to use and setup. It is triggered by<br />anything that moves in the cameras field of vision.  This could be a con for some users as some may want<br />to select specific areas to monitor motion or set up a higher motion range so that the family dog does not<br />trigger the device. This can be overcome by using other monitor software such as iSpy.<br /><br />The camera has two-way communication capabilities through a built in microphone and speaker. The sound<br />quality is good from the camera speaker. Con here is when speaking using the built in microphone is very weak.<br />You may want to add a quality microphone or speaker utilizingthe built in mic/spkr jacks located on the back of<br />the unit to improve sound and voice quality.<br /><br />You can do remote viewing via a web page or an app for your iPhone or Android phone. To test this, I used my<br />Samsung Galaxy Note and a free app called Foscam Remote which worked well. There are many other apps out there<br />that work as well.<br /><br />For sound, motion or both you may setup the supplied software to send an e-mail alert. It supports sending an<br />e-mail with pictures and IP address of the device which, if clicked on opens your web browser to view device<br />in real time even on your phone.<br /><br />If you need to view the camera outside your network via a web browser, you will have to setup port forwarding<br />on your router so you can locate the camera via your WAN's IP address. If your WAN does not provide or have<br />a static IP address, I used no-ip.org to track my dynamic IP address because it was free and dyndns.org is no<br />longer providing free accounts.<br /><br />Set up is easy for someone who has experience with this type of camera to set it up on a network and make it<br />work outside your network via a web browser. Novice users may find themselves at a slight disadvantage, but<br />should be able to get up and running by utilizing the provided software and documentation. If not, then there is<br />plenty of documentation and videos located on their website that should be able to help. YouTube has many videos also.<br /><br />The best thing about this camera was the price. You get all of this for less than $200 (double pack).  That's a<br />great price for a two camera bundle that has so many capabilities.<br /><br />Take a long hard look at the Foscam FI8910W.  It is a very capable camera when compared to other cameras in its price<br />range that is relatively easy to set up and use. From a cost and performance standpoint, it may well be hard to beat.<br />I plan to buy several more in the near future to complete my system.",03-02-2013

But be technical to set it up,I always read reviews with a grain of salt. I don't know whether to trust people's opinions or if their frustration unfairly influence their ratings. I don't understand everybody's complaint with these cameras. I love the ones that I received.  I'm disappointed that you cannot disable included DyDNS service. I'm also frustrated that it doesn't support SSL. But for 60 bucks apiece I think they're great.<br /><br />I agree the setup wasn't simple but only because users don't have the proper skill sets to complete the process successfully. Don't blame the product for your inabilities.  They're definitely not for a novice user. An amateur could figure it out if they were so inclined but they do take a technical skill set (or) patience & willingness to configured properly.<br /><br />And people who complain that you have to connect the cable or the configure the wireless have no clue what they're talking about. I'm a network engineer and I can't think of a single wireless product that doesn't require a wired connection for initial configuration.  You can't expect the wireless camera to guess which wireless network and password it's supposed to use.  Again don't blame the product.<br /><br />Great for the value.

Here's how it works:<br /><br />1) Toss the installation CD in the trash, it is basically only used to identify the IP that the camera is on (easy to figure out from your router)<br />2) Plug the camera into your router using the ethernet cable (mine was provided)<br />3) From a web browser type in the IP address the camera came up on (should be easy to find from your router's status page)<br />4) From your web browser, you should now be able to tell the camera about your wifi network via the camera's configuration page.<br />5) Unplug the ethernet cable and reboot the camera.<br />6) From your router, grab the MAC address to the camera (now connected on wifi) and permanently assign it the IP it came up on<br />7) If you have a domain set up, give the camera a name so that you don't have to remember the IP address. (optional)<br />8) You can now put the name (or local IP) into your web browser whenever you want to access the camera.<br /><br />At this point you have the camera set up on your local network. You can add users, set passwords, etc. all from any internet browser on your local network. If you want to open up connections from outside your network (like, say from your phone over 3/4g), you need to establish port forwarding to the camera.<br /><br />Be aware that if you don't have a static IP from your ISP that your IP may change, and you may need to update it (via various methods, some of which can be automated) in order to access the camera from outside your local area network.<br /><br />It really is very straightfoward if you know how to use your router. If your router software is difficult to use (as mine was), flash your router with dd-wrt to make it useful.",30-01-2013

My wife and I use this to keep an eye on our 11 month old while sleeping.  Using apps from the Apple App Store (and I'm sure they're on Android as well) we can connect flawlessly and see our son.  The camera supports full pan and tilt, tilting from 12:00 to about 4:00 and I believe it will make a full 360 turn, or close to it.<br /><br />The initial setup is done via ethernet to setup user accounts and network settings.  After adding it to your wifi network, it will always connect when the power is disconnected.<br /><br />The IR lights are powerful enough to see in complete darkness clearly and the automatic sensor will turn them off when there is enough light in the room.  The IR LEDs switching on and off can be a bit loud, especially in twilight conditions while the camera struggles to find the best lighting however this can be turned off.<br /><br />The software also supports user accounts and group security which is nice if you need to grant view only or operator access to someone.<br /><br />I do wish the power cord was a bit longer, roughly 5-6 feet or so.<br /><br />Overall, great security camera or baby monitor, would certainly buy again without hesitation.",30-01-2013

Unfortunately, it has too many bugs in my opinion to be ready for prime-time.<br /><br />Firstly, the web interface of Foscam.com does not permit you to download the drivers for the camera. This is highly annoying. You provide your e-mail address, and then you get an e-mail from Foscam with the links to download the drivers. Go to Foscam.com and hit downloads on the right. To make matters even worse, my camera shipped with firmware version \\""11.37.2.48.\\"" This is disappointing to me because after giving my e-mail to them the download link they sent back was for \\""11.37.2.46\\"" -- two iterations the predecessor to what the camera shipped with. That means that they don't update the download links and that the camera is effectively unsupported from the manufacture. I'm suspicious that this is part of the Foscam game: cheap disposable cameras that are primarily changed in just firmware. It doesn't seem like from the reviews there is much of a difference between the 8910W and the 8918W. And, on that note, who seriously decrements the model number when update the model?<br /><br />Foscam marketing, and support: 1.<br /><br />So, why would I care about the firmware anyway? Well, turns out Foscam models have a long standing issue with WPA2 and AES. Not sure why, or what the problem is. It's all closed-source proprietary trash from China, but the problem is there. Just search the internet for \\""wpa2 + aes + foscam\\"".<br /><br />Q/A: 2<br /><br />Now onto what most people care about, if you wire the camera up to a router you'll get pretty good performance and control out of it. The colors are decent and the I/R is pretty reasonable too.<br /><br />Picture quality: 4<br /><br />Still can't recommend this camera. It comes with a bunch of features but the ones that I'd find useful it does very poorly. It's reminiscent of a first-generation LG product from 2005.",29-01-2013

It either feedsback horribly or is too low for anyone to hear.<br />Zoom would be nice.<br />Setup was easy using the manual.

I gave it a try because I consider myself relatively savvy when it comes to technology in general.  I figured I would simply return it if I cannot get it to work.  I was close to returning it but I finally got it to work after tinkering with it for several days and reading online forums, videos and such.  Most people would probably just give up since it is so frustrating.<br /><br />The Good:<br />1)Good value for the money.<br />2)Decent video/picture quality.<br />3)Generally works as advertised once you get it working.<br />4)You can view the camera right away in your own network.  The problem is when trying to view it remotely which why most people want to buy this in the first place.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />1) Horrible installation instructions for viewing it remotely!<br /><br />This camera comes with it's own free DDNS account (free for 3 years) at xxxxx.myfoscam.org BUT IT DOES NOT WORK!  I tried it but I cannot get a successful DDNS connection.<br /><br />The instruction video tells you to use DYN DDNS but that service is no longer free.  Besides, foscam has their own so why not have instruction on how to set that up.  I ended up using the free no-ip.org ddns which is fine since it is still free.  I hope I don't have to pay for at least 3 years.  The instructions in general is just very confusing and the accent of the lady on the instruction video is so annoying.  What the hell is a rooter?<br /><br />2) Audio is bad.  It works to a degree but it picks up too much noise.  I don't care for the audio feature so I don't really care.<br /><br />Overall, I think it is a good product and a good value despite the installation headache.  I would not recommend it to someone who has a hard time getting computers/gadgets/technology related things to work.

IPCamera could be the ultimate solution for someone looking for a flexible baby monitor, here is my experience:<br /><br />The Camera:<br />* The picture quality is good for the cost, significantly better than the Summer Infant video monitor it was replacing<br />* Dark picture quality is exceptional<br />* The camera itself is larger than most packaged baby-cams though for us that didn't matter<br />* The speaker in the camera is weak so sending audio to the camera is a gimmick that doesn't work well<br />* The built in web monitoring tools are weak though you likely won't use them much<br /><br />Setup:<br />This is an IP Camera and does little or nothing to help the tech novice. If you know your way around a router and are willing to spend some time reading then it is easy enough to figure out (see the excellent info in the review from R.Tickle). To fully setup this camera you need to know how to do the following:<br />* Log into your router to find the cameras IP address<br />* Assign a static IP address<br />* Setup port forwarding on your router<br /><br />If you don't know what those things and aren't interested in learning then then this may not be the product for you.<br /><br />As a baby monitor:<br />The challenge here is finiding the right app for your device. For iOS \\""Baby Monitor for IP Camera\\"" is perfect and will do everything your out of the box solution does and more. Android is a stickier problem to solve, \\""IP Cam Viewer Pro\\"" seems to be the best option out there but it isn't ideal for things like overnight audio monitoring. I hope the options for both iOS and Android improve in the coming months and I expect they will.<br /><br />The advantages of having the monitor on all our \\""smart devices\\"" (we use iPad, iPhone, Android and Kindle Fire) as well as the ability for me to see my little one wake up when I am at my desk at work are huge wins for me. You can also capture stills or video right to your device which is something I wish I had many times with the out of the box monitor. Overall I believe an IP Camera is the best monitoring solution for any tech savvy parent, the benefits massivley outweigh the downsides.<br /><br />ONE BIG DRAWBACK. Using an IP Camera means that the monitor is stuck at home or will need to be setup on another wireless network to make it work. If you plan to travel a lot with your child and want your monitor to travel with you then I would suggest buying a cheap audio only monitor to suppliment this.

(used as a baby monitor),I am using this camera as a baby monitor to keep an eye on my child when they are sleeping (and for later one when playing in the room alone).  I do not use the audio monitoring as I already have an audio monitor in place with a handset.  The night time vision range and the wireless range of the camera is far beyond what I had expected at this price.  It really can see all the way across my nursery in pitch black without even straining.  The ability to monitor my child from my laptop or my iphone has been wonderful.  The ability to control the camera to scan the room or adjust the angle will be indispensable once we hit the toddler phase.  You can even view your child via this webcam when you are not even in state.  We've been able to give family members a link and password to peek in on the little one.

I prefer the DDNS service, and it works well.<br />Great pan and tilt, great night-vision. The app to use this on an android phone is not that great, but there are other apps that work equally well on this camera.

It is not HD but the pic quality is ok and the IR does work well.<br /><br />Second - I have a 64 bit W7 machine and this is not what you need to setup this camera. The IP camera Tool shows nothing under 64 bit systems and also if you goto 'basic setup' and try to enter your IP addresses manually it will say 'Illegal params' when you submit. I believe this is because the camera does not understand 64 bit packets etc. Eventually I did cotton onto this (after trying dozens of other measures such as no security on the wifi hub) and tried an XP 32 netbook I have. The IP camera tool found the camera and it took 5 mins to get the camera working. You do need to let it reboot when submitting changes and then unplug it so it reboots again but then it does work. I have remote access working (I think) but yet to do the email notifications which is what I really want working.<br /><br />I have also to say that my wifi Hub (BT Home hub 2.0) didn't really help - port forwarding is not very easy to fathom.<br /><br />I will update this review when I have done more - just to say that all indications are that it does not work with 64 bit windows.,20-01-2013

So Good!,"We raise animals, and wanted to be able to keep an eye on them when they were getting ready to give birth.  Decided to give this camera (2 of them actually) a try.  They arrived a day earlier than expected (another good job by Amazon!).  The items came with everything you need to get started.  The &#34;Quick Installation Guide&#34; was simple and easy to understand.  Start with the unit &#34;wired&#34;, make the connection with the router, then install the software, and make the connection wirelessly.  I  use MAC filtering for security on my network.  Both the wired and wi-fi MAC addresses are printed on the base of the unit, so... no problem.<br /><br />Wired... They are outstanding.  Image is clear, color is very good, 2 way sound is good as well.  Wireless...  The farther they are from your router, the harder it is for the router to &#34;detect&#34; the camera and the less responsive they are to commands (pan, tilt etc), and movement becomes choppy.  (Which is to be expected)  The location of my cameras are in covered animal shelters which are well beyond the far end of our (3000sf) house (opposite side of the house from the router's location).  I was bummed at the choppy performance at that distance.  So before I returned them as not suitable for my application, I thought I'd give something a try.  I purchased a Belkin Dual-Band Range Extender and added it to my home network.  I placed it at the opposite end of my house (closer to the camera's location) and ta-da... they work perfectly!<br /><br />These cameras are wireless b/g/n compatable, and the software allows for the monitoring of up to 9 cameras at a time.  I like that we can access the cameras from our computers and/or smartphones.  The only thing that I don't really like about the software is that it makes you &#34;Log in&#34; each time you want to view the cameras.  I want to be able to click an icon on my desktop and view my cameras.  Their configuration has you click their icon, double-click the IP address, click a log-on &#34;Submit&#34; button, and one other button before you get to the image itself.  (A bit of an inconvenience)  I guess I could solve this problem by assigning the camera a static IP address that is outside my router's DHCP assignment range, and place a shortcut to that IP on my desktop.<br /><br />Overall, we're pretty happy with the purchase.  They do what they're supposed to do, and that's all we were looking for when we purchased them.  The price was reasonable, and they really help us out.  Like I said at the beginning &#34;So Far...

Some people complained that there may be many fake reviews of this camera posted by the manufacturer, so that made me a bit reluctant to buy this camera, but at the same time, there were so many reviews and it is pretty high on Amazon's popular sales list, surely some of these positive reviews were happy customers. It seemed people who liked it really liked it and those who disliked it, absolutely hated it and considered it as a worthless piece - o - crap. After unboxing the unit and going through a few help videos on Foscam's website (which by the way borders on looking unprofessional), the camera was up and running with full audio. It works as advertised for me with the exception of the camera preset locations, that feature doesn't seem to be working for me. I did have to pay close attention to setting up the port forwarding in order to view the cam on the internet but it was quite easy if you follow the video instructions on their website. The video quality is decent and audio is adequate.

Setting it up via wire to the router was fairly painless. However, chances are you're not going to run CAT 5 cable from your router to every camera in your home/office so you'll want to set it up on your wireless LAN. Beware, wireless setup was a pain in the rear. I found that it seems to take awhile for it (the camera) to wake up and join the wireless network so be patient and let it sit for awhile. There are also 2 MAC addresses for this camera (which they didn't have documented) so make sure you use the right one if you have MAC filtering turned on for your home network.<br /><br />Buyers should also beware that this camera does NOT support SSL/HTTPS for logging in remotely!! This means your user name and password are sent across the internet in plain text (unencrypted). Which means anyone can sniff your username and password and log in to your camera. You can find some instructions online to stand up your own Apache Web Server as a reverse proxy, but that was a pain for me. In the end, I ended up installing Surveillance Station on my Synology NAS and downloading DS Cam from Google Play. This allows me to log in to Surveillance Station from my phone via HTTPS while away from home.<br /><br />As long as you can find a method to log in securely (HTTPS) this camera is awesome!",16-01-2013

US,47731549,R2BLNDM1LMW3AH,Foscam FI8910W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with IR-Cut Filter for True Color Images - 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67° Viewing Angle) NEWEST MODEL,Camera,4,1,2,N,N,"Very handy, but by no means perfect","First, for those reading reviews and seeing people complaining about the lack of support for cameras purchased on amazon, the foxcam.us site clearly states that: \\""For sales on Amazon.com, support and warranty extend to those products sold by Amazon (Ships from and sold by Amazon.com) as well as from Foscam Digital Technologies LLC (Sold by Foscam Digital Technologies LLC and Fulfilled by Amazon)\\"", so if you are buying from some other seller on Amazon, you may very well run into trouble, but there is definitely a \\""safe\\"" way to buy it here on Amazon.<br /><br />I bought the camera because our son moved from crib to bed, and we wanted to see how he was doing without having to disturb him.<br /><br />Setting up to use the camera \\""in the house\\"" was very easy.  Setting it up to be viewed outside the home networ, was a bit more challenging. I'd say that if you don't know how to get into your router settings you will have a very difficult time in general setting this camera up.  But, if you have the patience to watch the setup videos at the foscam.us website, you will muddle through it all and probably do so after an hour's worth of watching and tinkering.<br /><br />It is a lot less expensive than a comparable baby monitor, and I have to say it is funny as heck to watch my son climb out of bed because he wants to avoid his nap, but I can shout (\\""Get back to bed, it is night night time\\"" and see him immediately scoot around and get back into the bed.  Of course, I have no idea what he is thinking when I catch him but he doesn't see me.  That is what makes it funny.  I haven't used the speaker because I don't want him looking at the camera ... if he hears a voice coming from it, I expect he will get out and yank it off the dresser where it sits.<br /><br />It works well enough in the dark.  For some reason I did not expect the IR lights to be visible, figuring we can't see theinfrared spectrum so why should there be any visible IR light?  But all of those LEDs turn red when night vision mode is on, and it is quite visible in the dark as a result.<br /><br />The \\""presets\\"" don't work out of the box. Oddly enough, to set the presets will drive you mad if you read the instructions because deep in the menus the box to disable \\""presets\\"" is checked and that must be unchecked.  (Go to Device Management then to PT Settings, then uncheck the disable presets box).  Without the presets you have to pan the camera by touching/clicking an arrow. With the preset I have 1 set to the bed, 2 set to the crib and 3 set to the door, so I can quickly move to where I wish to have the camera point.)<br /><br />I don't know how baby monitors work but I am pretty sure they don't \\""sleep\\"" the way this camera does.  At times when I open up the App for viewing, it says the camera is not available and it takes 10-20 seconds to turn on.  Not a big deal.<br /><br />I have not yet set it up to e-mail me pictures, but like the feature more for security purposes when nobody is in the house than as a baby monitor when it would be sending me pictures all of the time as our son moves about the bed.<br /><br />I would highly recommend buying it from Amazon (I did not) because the return policy is much better than when you buy at Foscam.us directly. Not that I intend to return it, but I can see many people getting frustrated with the setup and deciding to choose another branded camera.<br /><br />Note, the website at foscom.us is very helpful. And the DVD has a manual on it that is much more detailed than the startup guide that comes with it (explaining what the network lamp is, for instance - you can turn off the blinking green and yellow lights that indicate you have a network connection -- in a dark room these blinking lights can be annoying. To turn off, go to device management, PT settings and uncheck network lamp).  But all of that said, if you know nothing about IP Addresses, port forwarding, routers, etc., and are short on patience and time, you may want to either takea pass or be prepared to return this baby.",09-01-2013

But at the same time, we like the VOX feature which turned the monitor on automatically based on sound.<br /><br />So why did we decide to get this?<br /><br />First, we figured that if it didn't work out for us, we could still use it as a general security camera but if it did, we could save over $100 so we took the plunge and got this one.<br /><br />Second, with this camera, we can have many, many more monitors instead of a single monitor.  We even have retired Android smartphones sitting around that we've re-purposed as a dedicated monitor.  With our laptops, tablets, and smartphones, we have 6 monitor-capable devices.<br /><br />After sifting through the many, many reviews, I did have some concerns about the setup, but I have to say that for anyone that has any inkling of basic network setup, this thing is a snap to set up and install.  A *snap*.  If you have basic experience with networking, you're likely not going to need the manual, watch any tutorials, log into any forums, or call tech support for basic setup.<br /><br />That said, I'm docking 1 star for three shortcomings:<br /><br />1) The first issue is that the web interface looks terrible and unprofessional.  Mostly cosmetic, but it's not that hard to write some decent CSS.<br /><br />2) The second issue is that there's no way (at least that I've seen) that I can turn off the network activity lights.  This is very annoying in a baby's bedroom and requires some duct tape to fix.<br /><br />3) The mounting bracket requires you to drill into the wall.  If it had a flat, plastic back, it would allow the usage of the included screws OR the usage of something like a 3M command strip (in fact, if the manufacturer is reading this, I would recommend revising the mounting bracket and including a 3M command strip).<br /><br />A good piece of hardware and I would definitely recommend to other parents and will definitely consider purchasing additional units.like a 3M command strip (in fact, if the manufacturer is reading this, I would recommend revising the mounting bracket and including a 3M command strip).<br /><br />A good piece of hardware and I would definitely recommend to other parents and will definitely consider purchasing additional units.",09-01-2013

The setup was a bit complicated, requiring port forwarding through my FiOS router, but figuring it out was not overly complex. The payback is full Web access to this unit. The night vision is excellent and the online access is simple (iPhone. Android, Windows. I haven't tried AppleOSs other than iOS).<br /><br />My only hesitation is that there is no zoom function, and the size of the unit makes it unsuitable for covert applications. I use this camera to monitor my home's family spaces to insure safety. So the obvious nature of this unit is not an issue. My family knows they are there and have been instructed that in the event of an emergency, get into view of the cameras. When we have family functions our distant family (cousins across the US, and in Singapore) can now interact through video and audio.",06-01-2013

Being in the IT field I usually look to see if there are any firmware or software updates.  There were, so I upgraded both.  When I entered the \\""Device Management\\"" I noticed an odd entry in the  DDNS Service Settings:  Undefined with a DNS entry of aj7320.myfoscam.org on Camera_1 and DDNS Service Settings:  Undefined with a DNS entry of aj7265.myfoscam.org on Camera_2  so I decided to copy and paste both entries into a web browser to see what I would get and low in behold it was the login to my Foscam Camera.  I then looked to see who the DNS Name was registered to myfoscam.org is registered to a company in China, yes I know Foscam is a Chinese company but I'm having I HUGE problem with someone from China able to monitor my house.  Nowhere in any documentation can I find that there will be a company DNS entry in the camera.  Also what user name and password they are using to monitor???  I then did some research on the Foscam.us web address (URL)  found a phone number from Houston, TX  1-713-893-7869.  I proceeded to call said number they accept no voicemail and want you to call back Monday-Friday 9 am - 5 pm CST.  SEE Robert J.

Since the point of a wireless camera is to be wireless, I relocated the camera after intial setup (I won't go into the problems with setting it up since so many others have done so). As long as the camera is in direct line of sight with my PC, it works fine. But if ANYTHING is in between the camera and the wireless router, then forget it (including my dog walking in front of it). No signal at all. It doesn't really matter how close the camera is. I have it right now in the next room at most 20 feet away. No signal. I even bought the extra big antenna...no difference. It is true that set up requires some work, but that only needs to be done once. Signal strength is forever and this unit fails on that particular front. You will be lucky to get a 10 foot range out of it. To be fair, I have had other cameras also fail on the signal strength front (e.g. Linksys).

I bought it as a toy but found that it’s a nice way of monitoring my house while I’m gone.  I followed the setup instructions in other reviews on here to get it going.  Now it emails me a series of pictures when it detects motion on my front porch – so I see when the mailman comes each day.  I can also view and control the camera from my iPhone and iPad at any time (there are many free apps to try).  The IR (night vision) doesn’t work for me because I have the camera pointing out a window from the inside, and that reflects the light back at the camera so you can’t see anything.  I have that function turned off and just turn on my porch light instead and it works fine at night. I don’t think this camera would work well exposed to the elements outside – too fragile.  I saw that Foscam makes an outside version too – that would work with the IR function then.  Overall, I like it and will get another one for my back yard when they go on sale again.",06-01-2013

The way I did it was to plug the camera into my router via Ethernet cable and then setup the WPA password via cut & paste. Once thats done, you merely place the camera where you wish to operate it. Its that easy! The camera will set its own time, and open a port via PNP (if enabled on your router) and register with a Foscam DDNS so that you can connect via the Internet [...]etc. One thing I would NOT recommend is updating the WebUI or firmware. The device came with firmware 11.37.2.47 while the latest on Foscams website is 11.37.2.46. The latest WebUI 2.4.10.2 also seems to disable Foscams DDNS and the Audio alarm function. For the price you really can't beat the older Foscams. If/Once they get there support up to par they will get the fifth star from me.<br /><br />Update 01/06/2013. Was browsing the Foscam website last night and noticed it had a &#34;talk to us&#34; button. I clicked it was speaking with a person in under a few minutes. It seems some of the camera's on Amazon have newer firmware & WebUI than the ones Foscam ships directly. This isnt a bad thing until you realize the versions of the software are misnumbered. Some of the versions on Foscam's website may or may not be older than what comes in your camera. This is an issue Foscam will really need to work out. The customer support was quick to respond and seemed knowledgeable. Until they get this worked out, I will continue holding the fifth star.<br /><br />Update 01/11/2013. Found Foscam.com's download had updated firmware and webui. As with the earlier install, things updated quick and painlessly. Best of all, the WebUI has the alarm by sound options and the Foscam (free) DDNS options added back in. I am as happy with this camera as the day I bought it!<br /><br />The camera has been working flawlessly since day 1 and I have even left it outside in a semi sheltered area more than once. I wouldn't leave these in the direct rain and snow but they work fine in extreme cold.<br /><br />The user interface is very to use even if you have never used a PTZ camera before<br /><br />I have seen others mentioning flying dots, insects or whatever in front of the camera from time to time.

Even without using any PC software you can have it email, gmail, FTP etc. images when it detects an alarm or even set it to upload/email a picture after a certain amount of time to use in making a timelapse video.The user interface is very to use even if you have never used a PTZ camera before  I have seen others mentioning flying dots, insects or whatever in front of the camera from time to time.

It is a real pain to setup if you aren't familiar with all the computer terms and where to find needed information to get all the links to work together.  Had my son-in-law do it, an electrical engineer and computer whiz, and it took him about three hours.  You need to be able to forward the picture if you have changing IP addresses which means you will need to subscribe to a service to do it.  It says it is free and it is for 30 days at a time if you continually use the service every 30 days, otherwise it can cut you off.  I went ahead and paid for two years to avoid the hassle.  It is very sensitive to movement and light changes seem to activate the camera sometimes.  I used Foscam Pro to control it.  It needs a way to remotely turn it off and on so you don't have to get hundreds of emails while at home with the unit on. I ended up unplugging it when home.  I tried pointing it at the ceiling but it still tripped and sent emails.  Quality of the unit seems fine.  Remote audio works about 50 percent of the time but that is not a camera issue.  When it does work, it is very sensitive to any noise.  The speaker on the unit does a pretty good job of relaying you talking through it from your phone.

Since I bought it on Amazon, I was able to return it no-questions-asked for a replacement.  I set up the new unit exactly as the one that did not function correctly, and I have not had any issues with it since.  Hence, I can only conclude that the first camera was somehow defective.  I did not attempt a firmware upgrade, due to published reviews from other purchasers where the firmware upgrade caused problems.  My take is the camera should work correctly &#34;out-of-the-box.&#34;  If it weren't for the defective camera, I would give this product 5 stars.  It seems very functional for the price.

It did a great job and I was very pleased with the results. The motion detect was great and the emailed photos I received let me know when my pet sitter came and went. I did not use any audio features, so cannot comment on that.<br /><br />Many reviews here comment on the great features, so I won't repeat them here. I'll restrict my review to some issues I had and general comments about the product.<br /><br />1. I work in IT so setting this unit up on my wireless network was no biggie. However, I can see how someone who doesn't understand (wireless) networking might get confused and frustrated. That said, many reviews comment on how good Foscam's customer/tech support is, so that's good. I didn't need to use it. For a great step-by-step method to setting up, see the review by R.Tickle from March 29, 2012.<br /><br />2. I bought my first unit towards the end of October '12. After 8 or 9 days it dropped off my wireless network. The only way I could get it to re-connect was to reboot the camera AND reboot my wireless router. It would be OK for a day or so, then do it again. Rebooting my wireless router was getting old, so I returned the camera for a replacement. It has worked flawlessly ever since.<br /><br />3. The replacement unit shipped with updated firmware and Foscam had made some changes. One was not for the better. Before, when I clicked IR mode, the camera went into IR mode irrespective of the amount of light. On the replacement unit, it did not. The camera decided for itself whether or not it thought there was enough light to justify IR mode. I find that annoying. To compensate, Foscam increased the range for the brightness setting. For example, at night a distant (20+ feet away) lamp in my living room provided sufficient light to prevent IR mode, even though the majority of that room was dark or in deep shadow. I had to jack up the brightness setting to be able to see the room. The original camera from October switched into IR mode when I told it to irrespective. I preferred that mode of operation.<br /><br />4. Setting up email so you can receive emails when motion is detected is a pain. Foscam are upfront about the fact Hotmail won't work, so I setup a Gmail account specifically for this camera. After a few dozen emails (forwarded to my Hotmail account), everything stopped. No emails! Long story short, Google had decided that the email traffic via the gmail account I'd setup was spam and had suspended the account. Idiots! I setup an Outlook.com email account instead and after fiddling around with the settings, it has worked well ever since. Just be aware that the camera software doesn't tell you if there's an email problem per se. The Test button in the UI only tells you something failed and is invalid if the email account setup is wrong. It doesn't tell you what is wrong, why it is wrong or how to fix it. So expect to spend some time fiddling with this function. That said, there is some good reference material on the Foscam website and on Youtube as well.<br /><br />5. Overall, for the price this is a great IP camera. I'd like to see HTTPS support and a zoom function, but apart from that it's a very good piece of kit.<br /><br />Happy voyeuring!o see the room.

Although there were negative reviews, I still bought them because of the features they offered (IR Full Night Vision, Pan/Tilt, 2 Way Audio) and because they were wireless. I use two of them at my vacation home and one at my regular house for surveillance, and though the first set up was confusing, the second and third only took about 15 minutes each. Word of advice, don't use YouTube or customer instructions, I used the pamphlet included and it made it so much easier to set up. (I tried with a YouTube video first and ended up having the factory restart the camera) The image quality is what I would have expected for a camera under $100, not amazing, but clear. I can see up to 20 feet and recognize faces fairly easily. The Pan/Tilt is amazing as it gives you so much more viewing power over what you're looking at (i.e Camera is pointed at front door but can still turn around and see rest of house). Audio is 7/10 with a good amount of clarity, but still some buzzing, however there is a port if you want to add your own microphone. (Only on Internet Explorer Windows Computers with \\""Acitive X\\"" can you listen to audio, unless you use an iPhone App). The speaker in the camera, used to talk to the thing you're looking at it useful but overall just an added feature. You couldn't hear it if you were more than 6 or 7 ft. away. I use my cameras wirelessly, but I would bet that if you used a direct ethernet connection, the speed would be better (there is a 1-2 second lag if you go wirelessly, but not something that should deter you) If your computer is on the same network as the camera, you can use the Application that came on the CD to view your camera (Multiple Camera Viewing on 1 page is only available on Windows Internet Explorer), but once you leave the house, you have to set up Port Forwarding through your router. This is probably the most confusing part of the setup, but I thought the guide explained it well. With port forwarding, and the included web address attached to the bottom of your camera (three years free included), you can view your feed from anywhere in the world and through your smartphone. Do not use No-IP or DynDns, just use the included web address and save yourself the trouble. I personally shelled out the $6 and bought FosCam Pro on the iPhone App store and it was worth it. Not only do you get the audio (I'm a Mac user), but the app also included digital zoom features (not included on the Mac internet applications only PC Internet Explorer). All in all, I am thoroughly impressed with this product, and glad that I caught it at such a bargain. Shipping was quick and easy.ined it well.

Wireless audio lags the entire system by about 2-3 seconds.Wireless video is delayed about 1/2 of a second and is barely noticeable. Wired seems to have very little lag and is practically unnoticeable.<br /><br />Back to the audio. Even cranked up the audio will be VERY low with the built in microphone if you plan to use it as a baby monitor it might not matter too much, but in that aspect it could be improved.<br /><br />Using a separate microphone and going wireless? I cannot say I can recommend this AT ALL as it gives a constant humming sound. I even went as far as removing the antenna and also tilting the antenna to be right above the power-supply cord - it had minimal affect on the noise and therefore cannot recommend this method right out of the box. There are supposedly mods that replace a resistor on it, but as stated before I've not had the time to tinker with it - I just messed with the default settings because of the lack of time.<br /><br />One last thing, the night vision on this camera is really good, however, the red LEDs might be a problem if mounted within sight of a child at night as they are pretty bright and noticeable. Keep that in mind if you plan on using it as a baby monitor.<br /><br />Once I figure it out and what's the best things to use with it I'll update this post (probably sometime within the month - time permitting). So as of right now, with JUST the out of box features and no modifications I can only give it a 4/5. Had the audio worked better it would be a 5/5 without a shadow of a doubt. I am a tinkerer so this review will probably go to 5/5 but with a warning indicating that this was indeed after modding and will include a guide on what I did to fix the audio problem as well as the apps used for mobile devices (I have both an Android Icecream OS and iOS) So I'll post those as well. Look for this between Jan 2, 2013 - Jan 8, 2013.",01-01-2013

Even though they are 640x480 resolution they are very usable for general purpose monitoring of our property.  The low-light performance is very good, even in their normal daytime mode without the IR turned on.<br /><br />As reported by others, the IR cannot be used inside the weather domes, the reflection of the IR emitters blinds the camera.  With our outdoor building lighting and a nearby streetlight the video is very usable at night.  They have been totally reliable so far, zero downtime, no video glitches, no issues.  We have used them wired and wireless and both are flawless.  The pan/tilt speed is adjustable and smooth.  The internal mic audio is very good and it's quite sensitive.  The internal speaker is not loud enough to be useful.<br /><br />The internal web servers work fine for basic access and configuration.

I wanted something with more functionality than the video monitors we found at baby stores. These would often only support their specific devices, and we wanted to view the camera from our phones, PCs, and tablets.  Remotely, and locally.  The Foscam does this really well.<br /><br />Setup was a breeze, I quickly realized that you'll really want a static IP address for the camera.  The camera supports it onboard, but I opted to leave it DHCP and have my router simply assign a specific IP based on the MAC address (I do the same for a couple other devices on my network).  I also set up port forwarding to a public address, so that I can access the camera when away from home (using appropriate security of course).<br /><br />Device support for this camera is amazing.  The protocol is open enough, that even on a new platform like Windows Phone and Windows8, there are multiple apps to choose from for the best viewing experience.  We can view the feed from any of our devices (Windows7 PC, Windows8 PC, Surface tablet, iPad, Windows Phone 8).<br /><br />We haven't had much reason to use it yet (until the babies come), but so far I've been very happy, and it has exceeded all of my expectations.

US,34384676,R16GQWGGXBMQ9M,Foscam FI8910W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with IR-Cut Filter for True Color Images - 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67° Viewing Angle) NEWEST MODEL,Camera,4,1,1,N,Y,"Great product for what it is - a very cheap, easy-to-use camera","I was wary buying the FI8910W after reading some of the reviews.  There seemed to be a few common complaints that I saw in the reviews.  First, the camera was difficult to setup.  Second, some users reported sound problems (too low, humming from interference, two-way audio not working).  Finally, there were a lot of complaints over the picture quality.  Please note: I am a Mac user, so all of my testing has been with OSX Lion, Safari, and a few third-party apps.<br /><br />Let me start with the first issue.  If you include hunting around for a place to plug in the camera I had this up and running and was logged into the built-in web server in about 5 minutes.  My major disclaimer is that I am a tech nerd with a networking background, so there's nothing in the setup that I found daunting.  To be fair to the average user, I followed the quick start guide that was supplied in the box and found that it worked perfectly.  The camera utility on the disk worked as advertised, and it got me right to the camera's web server without a hitch.  Normally when I hear complaints about things not working I always ask, &#34;did you read the manual?&#34;  Usually the answer is no.  So at least for the Mac setup, the manual is good and will get you up and running in no time.<br /><br />Second, the sound problems.  This is where I docked the FI8910W a star, but it's actually a software issue, not a hardware issue.  The built-in web server requires the VLC web plug-in for sound to work, but the VLC web plug-in for Safari does not work with 64-bit versions (the version a good number of people will have).  The VLC web plug-in for Safari has not been updated for several years, and it's unlikely that it will be actively developed in the future.  Basically that means sound from the built-in web server will not work for Mac users on 64-bit Safari.  I understand why Foscam went with VLC (it's free).  However, they screwed up big time when they didn't check to see if the VLC plug-in worked on current Macs.<br /><br />To test the sound I had to go to third-party apps.  I've tested the camera with EvoCam and SecuritySpy on the Mac, and FoscamPro on iOS.  For all three the sound worked perfectly, and FoscamPro's 2-way audio worked as well.  One of the complaints was interference in the audio feed, but I didn't notice any.  The gain on the camera's mic is turned up pretty high, so you do get a little bit of an audible hiss, but that's to be expected.  Any sound the camera did pick up was clear, and I could hear the TV show my wife was watching perfectly through all three of the apps.  The two-way audio via the IOS app also worked very well.  I had no issues with the sound being too soft as some users reported.<br /><br />Finally, the picture quality.  Here's where I stand firm and say, &#34;you get what you pay for, so stop complaining.&#34;  This is a sub-$100 camera, and considering all the features Foscam put into this product it makes sense that you don't have a 2- or 3-megapixel sensor in there.  It just wouldn't be economically viable.  The other side is that most people don't need that kind of resolution.  If resolution is really that important then you should be willing to spend more money on a higher end camera that meets your needs.  This camera is an entry-level camera, so don't expect it to compete with a $900 Mobotix M12.<br /><br />I was also pleasantly surprised at how well this camera worked with third-party apps.  The previously mentioned EvoCam, SecuritySpy, and Foscam Pro programs connected to the camera within a few seconds, and they were all able to control the PTZ and monitor audio.  I also setup the camera with Sensr.net's free trial, and that also worked flawlessly.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great camera for the price, and if you're looking for a starting point to dabble in IP cameras, or you're looking for a cheap monitoring solution in a non-mission critical environment, this is definitely the camera for you.  In only a few minutes I had the camera up and running, and over the next few hours I mucked around with a bunch of different programs until I came up with the perfect (at least for me) security monitoring system that includes motion detection, online backup, local recording, and automatic notifications.  Not bad for a night's work!",29-12-2012

I'm pretty sure all of the reviews that call out specific customer service reps are fake. Those users only have reviews for one item - this camera.<br /><br />Now, on to this camera. I was looking at video monitors for my baby's room and was just baffled at how some companies could justify charging 2-300 dollars for a video monitoring system. I looked into network security cameras and settled on one I felt met my needs for a far lower price. I think the price they ask for this is fair.<br /><br />Notes:<br />The plastic of the camera feels a bit cheap and flimsy, but once it is mounted, I am comfortable with it and sure there will not be a problem<br />It is larger than I expected it to be.<br />The camera occasionally reboots for an unknown reason.<br /><br />I will say that this camera probably will not be easy to set up for a lot of people. I feel like you need to have a medium-high level of tech understanding to get this running on your own.<br /><br />Here is a detailed list of what I did to set up the camera which can be used as a tutorial. This is Windows specific.<br /><br />In-Home viewing (Inside my home network)<br />- I ignored the CD that came with it. I find that most of the time the software provided by the company doesn't get in to the level of detail I prefer when setting these things up.<br />- Plugged the camera in to the wall, then attached the provided network cable to the camera and my router.<br />- Checked my router for the assigned I.P. address and MAC address of the camera<br />- Entered the camera's I.P. address and port number (I believe it was 22) into my web browser (I use Chrome), a la xxx.xxx.xx.12:22.<br />- Logged in as Admin and started going through settings.<br />  - Clicked \\""Alias Settings\\"" to change the camera name. I called mine BabyCam. When you are logged in to the camera, this will appear as the title in the tab you are viewing as \\""Device(BabyCam)\\"".<br />  - Date and Time settings. Set it to Central time and picked time.nist.gov as the time server to sync to.<br />  - Users. I added two additional users, one for me and one for my wife. Note that you CAN NOT change the admin password when you are logged in as Admin!<br />- Went back to my router and added a static I.P. for the camera. The exact process varies depending on the router you have, but the basic concept involves entering the MAC address of the camera and the static I.P. you want the device to have inside your network. I arbitrarily set the address to xxx.xxx.xx.49 and saved the setting, which restarts my router.<br />- Disconnected then reconnected the power plug to the camera. This causes it to connect to the assigned I.P. address you just created.<br />- Navigate to the new I.P. address you set up. In my case this is xxx.xxx.xx.49:22.<br />  - Log in to the camera.<br />  - Navigate to the \\""Basic Router Settings\\"" tab.<br />  - Uncheck the \\""Obtain IP from DHCP Server\\"" box. We want to tell the camera which I.P. to use.<br />  - In the \\""IP Addr\\"" box, enter the I.P. you specified as static in your router settings.<br />  - Enter your subnet mask. Most cases this is 255.255.255.0. To be sure, you can type \\""cmd\\"" in the Search box of the Windows Start button to open a command prompt. Type \\""ipconfig\\"" and hit enter. Subnet mask will be buried in the results, usually 4-6 lines from the top of the result output.<br />  - Gateway and DNS Server should be set to your router's IP address.<br />  - Enter a port number you want the camera to use. This can be any number, really. You don't want it to collide with anything else on your network, though, so pick something weird. I used the year of my birth and added a 1 to the end.<br />  - Leave \\""Network Lamp\\"" unchecked. Keeps that pesky green light on the back of the camera from flashing in your baby's room.<br />  - Click \\""Submit\\"". Your camerawill restart.<br /> - Once the restart is complete, go to the Wireless LAN settings and set up your wireless router properties if you plan to use the camera on your wireless network. When you submit, the camera will restart again.<br />- I ignored the ADSL, UPnP, and DDNS settings tabs. I set up dynamic DNS stuff on my own using [...]. Use the comment section if you want instructions on this.<br />- I also ignored the rest of the settings. Since I am using this for a crib monitor I don't really want a zillion motion-detected pictures taken. Babies move a lot. ;-)<br /><br />To change Admin password, log out of the camera interface, then log back in as one of the new users you set up. Change the admin password, then save. Camera will reset.<br /><br />At this point you should be able to use the camera wirelessly anywhere in your house and access the camera feed from any device in your network by using a web browser and navigating to the camera's I.P. address and port number, logging in, and clicking \\""Live Video\\"".<br /><br />For viewing on a mobile device, download one of many apps available in the Play store (I use an Android device). My app of choice is IP Cam Viewer Lite. This does not mean it is the best. :-)<br /><br />Good luck. Happy to answer questions in the comments section.e the camera on your wireless network.

It was the first time I did such a thing, but I do consider myself reasonably technically savy, and I learned a good deal doing it.<br /><br />- Besides using the free dynamic DNS host service provided by Foscam themselves (which is very nice of them to provide) to deal with the ever-changing IP address from my Internet Service Provider, I also signed up with [...] for a similar service, but this one allows me to automatically include the IP port on which I set up the camera (different from the default 80), so I don't have to type :XXXX at the end. It also allows me to have an easier to remember host name for the camera.<br /><br />- I liked that you actually don't have to install any software to connect to the camera remotely: once you have it set up, you can use a browser from any computer or mobile device, which is very cool.<br /><br />- The camera looks really good: nice texture and shape, looks like good quality, very silent when it moves.<br /><br />- Amazingly good price (<$80) for the features and  quality.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The printed manual that came in the box is quite sketchy. The full User Guide on the CD has a lot of good information, but it's written in very approximate English. Mind you, English is not my mother tongue either, but I tend to become suspicious of a product when it comes with a badly written (or translated) manual. Having said that, I've read some totally useless manuals in the past, and this is NOT one of them: you can actually follow the instructions despite its language shortcomings.<br /><br />- There is one feature which seems somewhat important and it hasn't worked for me so far: you are supposed to be able to define 8 predefined directions of view, and then just click one to have the camera pan/tilt to look in than preset direction. It just didn't happen for me, so I'm going to contact their tech support to see how to make it work. UPDATE: I got this feature to work! It turns out that it is disabled by default, and you need to turn it on in PT settings. The manual doesn't mention it, but if you go through the options in the web UI you can find it.<br /><br />- I went to the Foscam website looking for firmware upgrades (hoping that they might fix the problem above), but the link they give doesn't allow you to download anything: instead they ask you for your email address to send you upgrades, and they graciously warn you that they are going to spam you with future product offers at that email - no way to opt out of that. Searching the web for firmware upgrades, I just found a bunch of complaints from people who applied an upgrade only to have their cameras stop working, so now I am not that eager to upgrade anything now.<br /><br />Features not yet tried:<br />- Setting up email alerts and motion/sound alarm. Will try it soon and update the review. UPDATE: I just tried it, and it was really easy setting it up to send motion alarm emails to my gmail account, following the snapshot from the manual. For some reason the first 3 tests failed, but then it started working. The manual doesn't explain this, but the alert emails are actually very nice: they contain 5 or 6 snapshot frames taken a few seconds apart, so you actually get an idea what is going on even before you connect to the camera. The email also contains a clickable link to the camera, so it's very easy to get the live video and audio feed. Pretty cool!<br />- Setting up multiple cameras. If the alarm works, I am going to buy at least one more camera. UPDATE: given that the alarm works, I guess I have no choice but to buy another camera now :-)<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a really good product, with very few (and minor, imho) shortcomings. I would definitely recommend it.",28-12-2012

I purchased the white version of this item, same model number, from a different source on sale.  I actually got two.  I put one in each baby and toddlers room.<br /><br />It took a couple hours going through their online videos at the foscam website to get this going.  I am running a Mac computer so I believe it is a little more difficult but I could set one up again in about ten minutes.<br /><br />You have to hook these cameras up hard wire ethernet to the computer first, which they provide, to initialize them or something and then you can do the wireless thing.  The picture is very decent and I have them hooked up using the small antennas.  Mine came with both small, about 4 inche or so long antennas and some that are like a foot long.  Both cameras are within 12 feet of my router.<br /><br />I didn't have much success using my apple time capsule because the last update got rid of some things that the instructional videos go over.  An updated instructional video would be nice.  I ended up using the main FIOS router<br /><br />Anyway, there are plenty of mount options.  I mounted mine upside down and then checked the settings for flip and horizontal or something so that the picture is normal looking on my computer.<br /><br />I am happy with these and the pan/tilt feature.  I would have preferred a zoom feature as well but I did not look closely enough at the description.  They are kind of large in a bedroom if you are worried about looks.<br /><br />Here are the bad things.  If you have a mac, you can't put more than one camera in one browser window at a time.  It is not a supported feature. If you run windows, you can have multiple cameras tiled in one browser window.  It isn't a deal breaker for me but it is annoying.  The other annoying thing is that the Windows system has more options and has the listening function and speaking function from the computer and Mac does not.  There is a claimed work around for two way audio with Mac but I have been unable to get it to function.  The way I get around it is that when I am using chrome, I just have a tab at the top for the baby's room and one for the toddler. I click it and it opens a window and I press another option and the video pops right up.<br /><br />Either way, the infrared lights are more than bright enough in total darkness to see everything.  There are presets in the software that allow you to pick a spot and then just go back to it by selecting the number of the preprogrammed spot. You can move the camera all around and then just press the number and it zooms back to your spot.  The speed at which it can go vertical, horizontal, etc is all individually adjustable.<br /><br />The microphone is extremely sensitive. I can hear the baby breathing from about six feet away maybe 7.<br /><br />It is normally a color camera until it gets too dark and then it becomes black and white.  the infrared Leds can be turned on or off from the computer or phone app<br /><br />My favorite function I believe is the operation from my android phone.  I am using Ip Cam Viewer basic (actually upgraded to pro for $4, I forget what extra features there are) and I can pull up both windows on my huge galaxy note 2, 5.5 inch screen at one time.  There are many camera apps out there.  All you have to do is put in the correct IP address and port.  Pick your favorite app.  You have to select one window though if you wish to hear that particular camera microphone or do any panning, scanning, tilt, etc.  This application allows full control over the camera and has preset locations as well.  Both the computer and the android app allows automatic up/down constant scanning, or left right or kind of a zig zag pattern.<br /><br />My wife and I don't go out much due to the kids.  The last few times we have gone out we put both kids down to sleep at night, and have the 15 year old babysit. He really only has to be there in case they wake up or there is a fire.  So while I am at the restaurant that most likely has free wifi, I have my phone with its kickstand open an I am able to view my children live to see what is going on.  If the toddler starts to get up and take his diaper off to pee all over  I can call my son and have him intervene.  Or perhaps the baby is crying too much and I am able to hear this.  I can easily operate the cameras to move wherever.  I mention free wifi because I believe this live camera feed with chew up your data pretty quick on your phone plan<br /><br />It is great piece of mind so that we don't have to open the bedroom door to check on the kids and risk waking them up.<br /><br />As far as the cameras go, they do seem kind of flimsy.  They are definitely not outdoor cameras and I have no idea how long the motors will last.<br /><br />I would look for something smaller and maybe a little more rugged next time along with something that has a zoom feature.<br /><br />FYI, one of my cameras does work with the two way audio and one can only be used to listen to  the baby's room: it will not amplify sound from my android phone when I select that option.  I don't know why and it isn't terribly important at this point.",27-12-2012

I knew that the tech set-up would be a bit challenging.  After several hours perusing the manual I've been able to set up the camera and view on my computer but only if the camera is connected by ethernet cable to the router; I can't figure out how to connect (and validate) the wireless connection between the camera and my router (a Linksys WRT160N). A call to Foscam tech support routed me to a voice mailbox that was already full.<br /><br />The product manual is poorly written by someone for whom English is not the native language - it is full of typos and confusing syntax.  Foscam would do well to improve their manual and tech support.<br /><br />I'm going to give this some more time but right now it looks like I'll need to return the product - very disappointed.,27-12-2012

He indicated that they are having a lot of issues with the current firmware (11.37.2.48). He even downgraded the firmware to the previous version and still couldn't resolve the issues. I was told to return them for replacement. I will give the replacements a chance but if they have the same issues, they'll go back and I'll look elsewhere.

There are paid apps that will work and interact with it, but some can be buggy because they're made as &#34;universal&#34; apps rather than just for this model. Great piece of hardware though and we've been using it over a year now. I'd recommend doing what we did and buying a really cheap old Android phone for $10-15 somewhere and using it as a dedicated baby monitor with the app (condition and speed of the phone doesn't matter if you just need wi-fi and to run one app).

They been in service for over 2 months indoors and outdoors with no issues installing or performance wise. I got what I expected to get and that's a well rounded and somewhat inexpensive home surveillance system.  The star deduction is for poor swivel mounts and lack of decent software to unify a multi-camera system. I bought better mounts at a total cost of $20. I don't use Foscam's software at all. I went with a 3rd party vendor for an additional cost of $50 and everything is just how I want it.  Networking the cameras was easy and remote viewing works fine.  I also got an Android app to remotely view the live feeds for about $2.  I did use the internal server to configure automatic still image email and uploads to my ftp site in addition to what the 3rd party software does.  I do think that people who don't understand networking especially configuring routers would have some difficulty trying to set up multiple cameras, remote viewing, and things like that.  That's just the nature of how all of these things work however.  If a persons only experience with routers is plugging one in to a cable/DSL modem and setting up DHCP they will probably need some help figuring out how to make things work.",25-12-2012

These are great little cameras that will work over wireless - even WPA2 - so there is no stepping down to WEP64 or WEP128 to connect like some other IP cameras I've used in the past.<br /><br />There are so many ways to use these cameras - traditional web browser, one of the iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch Foscam apps, or email on motion detection. I'm sure there are Android and Windows 8 Phone apps available as well.  These work very well in low light conditions too.  I've had these cameras in my home, running non-stop for the last five months, and reliability has never been a problem.<br /><br />Alternatively, they can be wired via Ethernet.<br /><br />I wish Foscam made an outdoor weatherproof case for these indoor cameras so I could mount them around the outside of my house as well.

I'll admit that the microphone on this camera is crap. Trying to hear anything not close to the camera is pretty much impossible. However, the speaker on the camera is not as bad as people say. I can hear and understand when people talk through it.<br /><br />Interfaces.

They work with \\""tinyCam Monitor\\"" Android app and my wife's iOS app, sound and mic, so that's definitely a plus. Overall I do like them. Gotta say I'm very disappointed with their performance though, 5FPS MAX on wifi. I've got an Amped R20000G wifi router and get 22-25mbit throughput with all cams off over the 2.4ghz link, 19-21mbit with 1 cam on, and 15-18mbit with two cams on, when testing through my phone. My point here is that I have plenty of bandwidth left over and it's definitely not my network. The whole time I'm testing the FPS on the cams stays right at 5FPS. They don't do 5ghz wifi either, only 2.4ghz, but at least it's wireless N and WPA2 compatible. Shame too, get 65mbit throughput easily from my phone.<br /><br />Despite their shortcomings in the performance category, the picture is crisp enough I can recognize peoples facing and such at a good 20-30 feet. And for the price, half off if your smart and choose amazon warehouse deals, is pretty dang good for the compatibility and use. I wanted to give them 4 stars, but for the price, compatibility, and my usage I wouldn't be able to find anything better. So 5 stars it is.<br /><br />*Update 01/05/2012*<br />I did a lot of tweaking on my wifi and found that the 40mhz spread setting cuts the framerate by about 60%, which is odd cause it should have the opposite effect. The total bandwidth decreases but I guess the cams just aren't compatible with the signal. I dropped it to 20mhz and on wifi my cam's are getting 11fps each, pretty dang happy with that. Plus, since my wifi router has 5ghz radios as well it doesn't affect any of my PCs, I use the 2.4ghz radios exclusively for the cams.",22-12-2012

The unit is about 5\\"" high and the base is 4\\"" diameter.<br /><br />Second impression - it's made of cheap looking plastic. I paid $75 for this camera so don't expect much - just stating the facts. If it's dropped - I have no doubt the case will crack. Easy fix - don't drop it right?<br /><br />As per previous reviewers comments, I set it up via the browser and not the included software.<br /><br />The setup was relatively easy - but if you're not tech savvy - it would be difficult. In fairness, the included software might be recommended for those folks.<br /><br />Though a fair about of knowledge is required to set it up, there are certain things that could be made easier. For example, the setup for emails. Easier setup and help there would make it easier.<br /><br />Now on to the camera itself...the resolution is 640x480 is not great. There's a lag between what's happening in front of the camera and what's shown on the browser. This is locally. If using a remote software over the net, the lag will be more. It's functional, but don't expect to pan it left/right to follow someone around in real-time - not happening.<br /><br />The browser interface is ok - but as written before, certain features could be made easier. You can use this interface on your mobile browser and see the camera. It works but not usable because the page resets every time you do a pan/tilt action. So most probably will need to buy an app.<br /><br />The unit came with the network cable (to connect to router) - very helpful! Also, a wall stand.<br /><br />I bought this as a test device to see how I could implement a security system with a few units. Unfortunately I'll have to keep looking.",21-12-2012

Here are my two cents:<br /><br />Camera and software is for the most part excellent (for the price).  It does the job as advertised.<br /><br />The setup to get the camera working on your local wireless network literally will take less than five minutes (even if you are not computer savvy).<br /><br />The setup to get the camera working OVER THE INTERNET can have some pitfalls if you get sidetracked - I'm going to give you some tips to avoid getting sidetracked - First - DO NOT try to follow the Youtube instructions, I think from Awkward Hamster - it's likely your router is not the same as his, and it's easy to get messed up trying to follow his instructions.  Another thing is this (and it's a big one) - DO NOT use the DynDNS service that everybody talks about - it's either no longer free, or they have become very good at hiding the free part of their service.  Something AwkwardHamster does not mention is that Foscam offers FREE DDNS service for three years, and it sets up completely automatically through the camera software - TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS.<br /><br />Here's how to avoid problems and get a quick internet connection setup for your FOSCAM camera - Two Ways:  One, there is a setup video on the CD that comes with the camera.  Follow this to the letter and it is very easy to set up the camera (although they push the DynDNS service for some reason, which baffles me, because you get three years of Foscam DNS FREE OF CHARGE). Also you have to suppress laughing at the horrible accent of the instructor.<br /><br />Secondly, if you can follow the written setup instructions that come with the camera ( I actually recommend this method ) - and they aren't too difficult - these actually walk you step by step through the entire setup process for the camera.<br /><br />And yes, once you do it a couple of times it is all easy as pie and it does work as advertised...<br /><br />Now, the caveat - I have a fair amount of computer experience and would probably be considered an expert by 90% of the computer public - but I tried setting up my camera system according to the Youtube videos, and ended up:  Crashing new Windows 8 computer (had to do a Restore on it); crashing Belkin N dual band router (had to do a Restore to Factory Default); did some goofy stuff to my DSL modem re: the internet connection - and a couple of other weird things...<br /><br />Either follow the video setup instructions or the written setup instructions that come with the camera and you will be fine. Don't be intimidated and if you get stuck or something goes wrong just keep trying and you will get it to work (I got really messed up and just kept working it until I got it up and running, I never called Foscam help or any of that)...",21-12-2012

This IP camera is really the best. It costs way less, it has way more options (incl. moving the camera from your phone or pc) and the picture quality is just great! The night vision is also great quality! There is nothing bad to say about it.<br /><br />Set up is not bad at all. It might take you a few more minutes if you never did any hardware setup but the installation video that comes with the installation CD is really helpful. You can also add different users ( incl. passwords) and can set them as admin, operator or visitor.  I also used a free web address from no-ip so it's easier to remember than the IP address you get.<br />My family who is thousands of miles away in Europe can also log in without any issues and even operate the camera and direct it.  I just love it!  I will buy another one or two later on to build a whole security system.<br /><br />There are also options to set alarms that will be triggered by motion or sound, you can add input and output audio and many more but didn't try those yet!<br /><br />Would and will buy it again!",21-12-2012

I like to think I can figure out most tech things if given enough time and I have Google available to help troubleshoot my questions. 2.  If it didn't work, I knew it would be an easy return to Amazon.<br /><br />I ordered 3 cameras and also ordered Foscam Blue Iris software.  I used the install disc that came with Camera #1.  It was really simple.  I followed the instructions and it worked both with my ethernet and with my wireless network.  Changed the port settings per the instructions and no problems there either.  My IP is static, so I didn't have to go through those issues.<br /><br />My only cons were I could not get it to work with Chrome, which is my preferred browser.  Worked fine with all three cams on IE.  This won't really be an issue in the future as I'm using Blue Iris to monitor it from my PC and then IP Cam Viewer ($3.99) on my android applications.  Blue Iris is not really that intuitive at first, but the help section really lays out all you need. Although this is not a review of that software, I bring it up because it is basically my interface, recording, viewing, etc., so it obviously is key to having a good experience with the cameras.<br /><br />The video quality is good in both light and dark.  You can adjust a lot of the settings for how choppy it will be, brightness, contrast, etc.  It is more than enough for me considering the price.  Maybe I got lucky, but I would give it a shot and see if you do too.  I cannot comment on how helpful customer support may or may not be, as I fortunately set up everything this evening in a couple hours.<br /><br />My wife is already rolling her eyes because I excitedly showed her an email alert with a motion triggered screenshot.  :)  My only major complaint: 2 days after I bought three of these the price dropped twenty bucks.",18-12-2012

After trying to read their poor-grammar &#34;quick set up&#34; instructions for an hour, I gave up and called an expert.  I did not try to call the company.  It took my friend who is an IT manager 15 minutes to set the camera up to wireless and another 5 minutes to help me set up the Foscam App that I downloaded from itunes for $5.99.  (There are tons of other IP camera apps out there for free but I just thought I should go with a product specific app.)<br /><br />If you don't plan on using this product wirelessly, you will need to purchase a longer CAT5 cable.  The one in the package is about 2 feet long and intended just for initial set up use.  They make a version without the antenna if you don't want to go wireless.<br /><br />THE CAMERA - it is very quiet, responds fairly quickly to remote commands (pan and tilt) and, so far, has never lost its wireless signal. I cannot find anywhere in the packaging that this product can be used outside.  The power cord is very short (about three feet).<br /><br />IMAGES - Infra Red - Can't shoot through a window at night, it just reflects the IR lights in the window, so I would suggest getting an infrared light and placing that outside your window if you want to monitor at night.  This camera has the capability of turning the IR lights off manually.  We have a street light in front of our house and you can see the light at night with the camera but you wouldn't be able to make out faces or car colors without the addition of an extra IR light outside.<br /><br />Daylight images - Great and are better resolution than I expected.  It has a built in adjustment for outside photographs and self-adjusts the contrast.  From the monitor on your computer screen, you can only pan an tilt.  But you can zoom with the ITunes Foscam app, and take pictures and video straight to your phone.<br /><br />MICROPHONE AND MONITOR - Wow!  I did not expect this feature.  With the Foscam iPhone app, I can talk from my phone through the camera.  I can also listen to the room through the monitor. I LOVE both of these features and did not see them listed when I purchased the camera.<br /><br />***** I was originally going to rate this product four stars because it is so difficult to set up but after using the camera for a week, I just love it and I'm rating the camera, not the set up.  The set up is difficult so if you don't know an IT person or can't figure out how to set up a static setting through your router after determining the camera's IP address, you're going to need to call technical support and I can't speak to that experience because I did not try it.  One reviewer suggests skipping the included disk when setting up the camera, I tried that, it didn't work.  Also, using the WSP feature will not work either because you have to make manual changes to your router.",18-12-2012

Are you !@#$ing kidding me?,"Let me start by saying that I am a software engineer. I also have a strong interest in computer security and keep up with a lot of the latest security tools and trends. I was interested in acquiring this camera for, you guessed it, security. I have some dog walkers/cleaning people/etc. that I want to keep tabs on. That is why I am shocked that this device features absolutely no inkling of security whatsoever. None. Zero. No SSL/HTTPS. Not even digest access auth (lulz).<br /><br />This means that every time you log in to your camera, your username and password is sent CLEARTEXT over the wire. The username and password _to the video camera recording inside your house_. The most ridiculous part is that the manual is so nice to walk you through setting up access to your camera from the Internet. Great! Now you can check on your 50 cats at the Holiday Inn or Joe Schmo Coffee shop.

I would consider myself highly technical and would suspect that non-techy people will struggle with the configuration.  My advice would be to make appropriate arrangements with either Foscam support or a trusted resource to help walk you through the setup/configuration.<br /><br />I primarily use the camera to keep an eye on our dogs when traveling.  I use both iOS and Android devices which both work very well on 3G and 802.11 networks.  I highly recommend the IP Cam Viewer app from Robert Chou.<br /><br />The camera software appears to work fine in both Internet Explorer and Google Chrome.

I have Win7 PC and Fios Router.<br /><br />I did update the camera web interface sfw, which improved accessing it via PC, but ruined accessing it via my blackberry.  I completely lost access via my blackberry.  So this was upsetting, but it was never that great anyway.<br /><br />On my Kindle Fire (android device) I downloaded tinyCam Monitor and it works great for viewing the camera.  Way better than the web interface included with the camera via Internet browser.  I only have the free version right now, which is limiting, but I will be buying the full version.<br /><br />The camera works great.  The Night Vision works excellent - can see clearly in pitch black.  The sound works great as well, much more clear than my baby monitor!  I have not tried speaking to the camera yet.  So I'm not sure how well this works.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased with the camera and I ordered a second one that should arrive this week!",17-12-2012

When wired, the camera works fine.  According to the documentation, you have to put in your wireless settings in the camera (which I did) and when it reboots, you have to wait til the countdown gets to 0 then pull the network cable. After that the camera doesn't work.  If I let the camera sit for about 2 hours, it will finally connect to my wireless network. The camera then works fine... that is until you unplug it. You'd think that once you have a successful connection, powering it off and placing it in it's location and powering on would work? of course not. The darn thing just won't connect. So I decided to return the 2x cameras I purchased thinking something was wrong.  Got 2 new ones today, same thing.  It will not connect to my wireless network!  These cameras are useless by all means. I'm returning my 2x Foscam FI8910W junk and finding another company.",16-12-2012

If it works,"I picked up 3 of these on sale. 2 for me and 1 for a gift. One of the 2 for myself was defective. The nightvision mode did not always work properly. Apparently many other people have had an issue with the Infra Red filter not disengaging when the camera goes into night vision mode. That means that the camera cant see the IR light that gives you your night vision. The other camera works great. Amazon has a great return policy for replacements, so a new one is already on the way.<br />These cameras have a nice feature list and are very cheap compared to other comparable cameras.  The wireless networking is a bit of a pain to set up, but it works. The instructions are surprisingly good.

A great buy! So simple, an adult can install it!","This is a great camera, took less than 10 minutes to set up! The only thing that I had a problem with is the CD that came with it was cracked, didn't matter though, Foscam has everything on their website that you would ever need to set this little guy up. Foscam even has an Android app that you can use with this camera. It seems to be built very nicely, and very quiet too, you can't hear this thing pan or tilt at all.<br />I've seen several reviews that stating that they couldn't get the connection to work, Foscam details the installation on their website step-by-step. They have the basic set up, the wireless set up, they even break it down step-by-step for 7 different routers! With screen shots! If anyone has a problem setting this up they really need to visit the website and go to the SUPPORT tab, it will help you a great deal. It really isn't difficult to set this up, just a few steps to follow.<br />The picture quality is really good compared to a lot of other cameras I've seen (for the money, it's great). The picture quality over the internet is very good and the IR quality is amazing! I couldn't believe how well this little thing lit up a room in complete darkness, I haven't tested exactly how far, but it's at least 30ft.<br />I am very glad I made this purchase, and will probably get a few more to use with our security system.",14-12-2012

They answered my email within a couple of hours and attached the latest firmware to try. The firmware that they emailed to me was newer than what was available on their website. After updating the firmware on all 3 cams, everything seems to be working fine.

Very satisfied.,"After doing a good amount of online research, I chose this camera due to its popularity and generally good reviews and am very satisfied with the result.  We are particularly impressed with the quality of the night vision of this camera.<br /><br />The setup process was fairly straight-forward (for a technical person) and I almost got the remote camera access working on my own but chose to contact Foscam Technical Support, where Kate was most helpful.  They can remote right into your computer to inspect the router and camera configuration and very swiftly resolve your issue.  In a few painless minutes, Kate made the necessary corrections to the config and concluded the call with confirming she could remotely connect to the camera over the open internet and operate it.<br /><br />For our application, our needs were fairly basic.  Our primary need was the auto-generated emails in response to motion detection.  Once this was properly set up, it works great.  The one thing I did realize after a little frustration is that you need to first &#34;Submit&#34; your Mail Service Settings before doing the test.<br /><br />The motion detection works great and we are only using a sensitivity of &#34;5&#34; (middle of the range).  We are anticipating that we might get a few false positive email notifications on account of night vision toggling or lights on timers turning on/off, but we'll acclimate accordingly.<br /><br />My wife is using the Foscam app (for purchase) on her iPhone and I am using the free &#34;IP Cam Viewer Basic&#34; app on my Android.  Both apps seem to work great.<br /><br />I'm not sure what is behind some of the negative reviews out there for this product.  Works great and we're more than satisfied.

( sun behind trees for example ) Sure, you can lower the sensitivity to avoid changes in lighting, and also enable motion compensation, but the IR to regular and regular to IR switching will still generate a false alarm, and at lower sensitivities, the camera will only really pick up motion about 3 feet in front of the camera, beyond 3 feet there could be 100 people moving about and the camera will not pick it up.<br /><br />Tech support at Foscam is the worst I have experienced, it is almost as if they grabbed a random person off the street to field my call. I literally knew more than they did after a few hours of working with this camera. The simplest of questions could not be answered. If they tell you they will call you back, don't bank on it, it wont happen.<br /><br />Also, be prepared to stay on hold for at least 30 minutes before anyone picks up, once that person picks up, they will have you wait another 30mins to 2 hours for a callback while they find a random person off the street to field your call.<br /><br />Stay far away from this camera, Foscam surely is aware of these false alarm issues and either does not have the desire to fix it, the ability to fix it, or both.",11-12-2012

When it came up as a lightning deal I jumped. This is an awesome product that does everything I want and more. The people having problems with setup are baffling because I followed the directions exactly and it worked. I read reviews that said not to use the installation CD that comes with it but I thought I'd try that first to see what the issues were. I plugged in the camera and plugged it into my router with the supplied ethernet cable. I popped the CD in the drive, navigated to IPCamSetup.exe and ran it. It immediately found the IP of the Camera and prompted me to login. The default username and password are in the manual. After I logged in, I selected which browser I wanted to use and POOF it's connected and the picture appears. This took maybe 3 minutes. The amount of control you have is amazing. From vertical and horizontal patrol to scheduling recording times to motion sensing, sound sensing, 2 way audio, email alerts... the list goes on and on. After it was setup as hard wired, I followed the directions to set it up wirelessly by going to the device manager and selecting the wireless LAN settings tab. (as the instructions tell you) Clicked scan (as the directions said) and it found the SSID of my router. (as the instructions said it would) I simply entered the share key and submit. The camera rebooted and once again... POOF, it's now working wirelessly. I mounted it on my front porch with the included mounting bracket and the entire ordeal took 10 minutes tops.<br /><br />I understand that some may have a different setup than I do, but that doesn't mean the product is junk. Initial install was on windows XP SP2 and subsequently I installed it on a windows 7 machine. I also found the greatest app for my iPhone and iPad. It's the FoscamPro app and it's $5.99 but well worth it. It does absolutely everything you would want it to do. I have mine set to alert/record on motion. You can set the sensitivity and it's setup to email me and record the video to my dropbox folder so I can see the video remotely as well as monitor the camera. UPS delivered a package for me and it alerted me when they reached the front step. I used the 2 way audio and told them to leave it inside the porch area. How cool is that?<br /><br />I'm buying more of these. I only wish they were water/weatherproof so I could mount them outside as well.<br />This is a really good product, fake reviews or not!",11-12-2012

Not knowing whether or not that was true... I took a leap of faith and bought two of these cameras.  I absolutely love them.  No, they aren't HD.  No, they aren't top of the line.  YES, if you want to set up remote viewing, you have to be somewhat knowledgeable about router settings and DNS. (If you don't know what a router, IP, or DNS settings are.. don't expect to have remote viewing, just in-home viewing via the provided application)  The IR only REALLY works for about 3-4 feet, so don't expect them to see in the dark.  Given all that, show me a better camera for &lt;100.00 that has a 300 degree pan/viewing angle!  I don't regret this purchase for even a minute and plan to buy additional cameras including outdoor models.  That \\""static\\"" interference that some people have mentioned on the audio out is true.  You have to keep the volume to a minimum effective range on the connected speakers to prevent a loud buzz.  I imagine this is a grounding or interference problem with the wireless and there might be a work around.<br /><br />All in all.... I love these!<br /><br />*****Update:  In the original review, I mentioned that the IR only worked for 3-4 feet.  That is incorrect.  When it's working correctly it illuminates the entire room! The trick is getting it to work correctly. One of the two cameras I have works fine all the time. The second one needs a little coaxing. When it turns on correctly, it makes an audible, distinctive, \\""click\\"", presumably from the IR filter. When it doesn't fully engage, the click is a quieter, incomplete, click. I read on a forum that if you hold a relatively strong magnetic (speaker magnet, hard drive magnet) just above the camera, you will hear the click complete and the IR works great. I spent some time turning it off and on, coaxing with the magnet when needed, and it appears to have improved.  Almost as if it just needed to wear in a bit.  Regardless of the price, only shoes should need to be worn it! As such, I'll probably move the rating to a 4 for this. Still love the camera and don't regret the purchase!of the price, only shoes should need to be worn it! As such, I'll probably move the rating to a 4 for this.

However, before you buy this thing, make sure that you have someone who has enough computer knowledge to tackle setting up port forwarding and to know what an IP is.  Most homeowners do not have static IP and will need an account on no-ip.com to track the dynamic ip addressing.  The Foscam website has very good step-by-step videos.  However, these videos are not updated to the latest version of your browser or wifi router.  So for a real amateur one can get thrown off track.<br /><br />Well, owning a Foscam forced me to really learn about port forwarding and dynamic ip addressing.  I am now savvier with computer network, and I have three great surveillance cameras that take pictures and sends them to my email account.  I can also use my iphone to \\""see\\"".

Nothing so far at all, it's been 3 months. It appears they have now removed their phone number from their public website as well.<br /><br />A very shoddy way to do business.<br /><br />******************************************original review below*************<br /><br />I recently purchased one of these cameras during a lightning sale, and it worked so well that I purchased 4 more, for a total of 5 cameras for a couple of properties I own.  These are bar none the most amazing, best cameras I have ever used.  I have used closed circuit cameras, various earlier generation brand cameras (including a finicky Linksys cam that worked 50% of the time and cost twice as much).<br /><br />The resolution of the cameras are amazing. I am able to watch from PC, iPhone / iPad, and my Android devices, anywhere, with near 100% reliability. As long as you have data, it should work flawlessly.  Just amazing.<br /><br />However, since these cameras rely on your home wireleness network working well, as well as a small amount of effort to set up a dynamic DNS (I used no-ip.com for free and it works great) so you can view the cameras outside your home - DO NOT BUY / INSTALL these cameras if you are: stupid, lazy, have no idea what WIFI is, what an IP Address is, OR even knew what the admin page of your router is.  Many of the complaints here are due to people lacking some basic understanding / expertise around home networks / ip addresses.  IF you fall into this group of people, either HIRE a TRUSTED person to do it for you (a close friend / family member who knows more about computers than you do), or outsource this to the Geek Squad (as much as I hate them).<br /><br />Here are the steps I followed to install the cameras:<br /><br />1. DO NOT install the software from the CD. I can find no good reason to do so.  Instead, I plugged the camera into my router via ethernet cable, and plugged in the power cord.<br />  1.a  Once the camera is booted and on the network via ethernet, log into your router admin page (eg 192.168.0.1) or something like that - and look up the IP address of the camera (eg. 192.168.0.101)<br /><br />2. On your browser - type in the IP address of the camera (eg: 192.168.0.101)<br />  2.a  This will bring up the camera view / set up page.  It will ask for a user / password.  The default is \\""admin\\"" for user, with password field blank.<br /><br />3. Once you get past the log in page, depending on the firmware, it will show the video immediately. You can pan, tilt, and scan (no zoom).  You can also go to the settings page (Device management) and set the various parameters for your network.<br />  3.a  Turn on wireless settings if you are going to use this on wifi (most people will, since these cameras are going to be in remote locations away from a router / switch).<br />  3.b  set up users and passwords (recommended to add password to Admin, and create additional users for \\""operators\\"" who can't change camera settings).  Note - once you change password, the camera will reboot, and ask you for the password immediately!!  Don't forget the passwords!!<br />  3.c  set up a unique HTTP Port (I recommend a single value 8000 - 8999).  If you don't know what this is, please consult a friend who knows about port forwarding, or google it, watch Youtube videos, etc., about the camera set up.<br />  3.c.1  Once you have set up a unique HTTP port, the camera will reboot.  When you log back to the camera, you MUST add the port to the IP address - eg:  192.168.0.101:8000  .  Without the PORT # to the IP address, you WILL NOT find the camera!!!  I suspect a lot of people trying to set this up don't do this right and then come here and complain about the camera, when it's their own fault.<br /><br />4.  Go to No-ip.com, create an account, set up an alias (eg.  myaddress.no-ip.org) that you will be using from outside the home to watch the camera.  This is 100% free and works great.  I recommend a small donation to no-ip.com if you like to thank them for their service.<br />  4.a  Once this is done, go to the DDNS service settings of your camera and enter it there.  Camera will reboot and show either the DDNS settings were successful or failed.<br /><br />5. Once wireless is turned on the camera, disconnect the ethernet cable.<br />  5.a  Log into the router, and look up the wireless IP Address (denoted by foscaxxxx_1 in the device name)<br />  5.b  log into the wirelss IP address with the PORT # - eg: 192.168.0.102:8080 (not the ethernet IP Address!!)<br /><br />6. If you are successful thus far, then set a static IP address for your Foscam to guarantee reliability<br />  6.a Using a linksys router, I set my static IP for the wireless FOScam as 192.168.0.199, for example.<br />  6.b  After this is done (saved the settings on router, etc), turn off the camera, router, and then turn everything back on to allow the static IP address to take effect.<br />  6.c Log into the router to check that the static IP address is working.  Test by going to the static IP on your browser - eg:  192.168.0.199:8000, and log into the camera to make sure it is working.<br /><br />7. If everything looks good thus far, then log into the no-ip address to make sure everything works:<br />  7.a  Log into  myaddress.no-ip.org:8000 (your alias and your port #) to make sure everything works. It should if you understand and have followed my directions above.<br /><br />8. Voila - done, enjoy!!!<br /><br />Some additional notes:<br /><br />1. Internet Explorer sucks, don't use it (I have IE 9 and the active X control kept crashing my IE).<br />2. Install Chrome, and use it.  To do so, use the \\""Server Push Mode\\"" and everything works great.  Use Chrome for everything if you can, ditch Internet Explorer (saying this as I have to use IE for work and I grudgingly do so).<br />3. If you own an iPhone / iPad, the free Cam Viewer app works great for this device.  Many other cam apps work also.<br /><br />If you were able to follow the very SIMPLE (yes simple) directions above, and get it to work, kudos.  If what you read was gibberish, DO NOT buy this camera, or hire someone to install the camera for you!!!<br /><br />One thing to keep in minde - who ever installs the camera for you with the network settings can view your camera if they want, any time, any where!!  So if you do this, make sure you make them teach you how to log into the camera ADMIN page, and change the passwords for the admin user, and any other users that are set up, so only you can log in and view the camera.<br /><br />This is pretty simple stuff, if you have any desire to learn about basic home networking, can watch some Youtube videos that go through this stuff, read some online forums, or just can RTFM!!!<br /><br />This camera is amazing.  I highly recommend it, but only if you're not stupid or lazy.ort, the camera will reboot.  When you log back to the camera, you MUST add the port to the IP address - eg:  192.168.0.101:8000  .

I bought a cheaper cam earlier which works great, but you can't tell it WHEN you want it to motion detect.  Setup for this was easier than a lot of people here make it out to be.  The first review with the individual steps was very helpful.  There are also a couple of videos on youtube that are great for setup help.  One thing I thought may have been buggy was the email service.  I couldn't get it to work.  Finally, I realized that I had it scheduled to video capture at 3:00am, not 3:00pm.  This is because the scheduler is in military time!  I wish it had zoom.  Sound and other features seemed to be better tailored for IE.  Spring for the four dollar app. if you want to use the iPhone. It is really good.  One thing I find interesting is the amount of heat this thing generates in the base.  No idea what causes that.

Packaging was good and the aux stuff was first class.  The provide a short network cable for initial setup.  Rather than sending a simple and inexpensive LAN cable, they sent a very nice retractable cable.  Very classy.<br /><br />Also, Foscam provides a dynamic IP resolver.  When your camera boots up, it contacts the Foscam server with its IP.  Actually, the NAT address of your router.  Foscam then provides a static URL for your camera which you can use to access the camera.  i.e. abcdef.myfoscam.org<br /><br />Spent a couple of hours playing with it.

Tilt/Zoom is great and there really isn't anywhere you can't see, pretty much no blind spots.<br />I can pull up and use all pan/tilt/record/snapshot from anywhere I am and have the FoscamPro app installed on my iPad,iPhone, and android devices.<br /><br />Since they don't use a central receiver (they go off of wifi or hard wired) the range is as far as your home network extends which makes them even more dynamic. I currently have three up and running.<br /><br />I found a very easy way to monitor these (if you don't want to keep it on your computer or device)-<br />I used the Logitech Revue, hooked it up to a small tv and now I have a central 24/7 Security monitoring screen.<br /><br />These cameras really couldn't be any easier to set up/manage and monitor than they already are.<br />I have tried seven different brands and many cameras and none come close to the Foscam.<br /><br />I suggest you try Foscam, if you don't like it send back , that simple. But I have a feeling if you have ever tried any other home cameras you will not only keep it but buy several more.<br /><br />For the quality of images, quality of product itself, features and price- You can't go wrong.<br /><br />I buy over 400 items a year from Amazon and always give an honest review in order to help those trying to make a purchase decision.<br />This product rates 5 stars for use-ability, construction and price.ng to make a purchase decision.<br />This product rates 5 stars for use-ability, construction and price.",09-12-2012

I find that it lives up to its strong reviews.<br /><br />I'm writing to give a few details about setup, since that seems to be the main issue that people are having.  Some say that you need a PhD in order to set it up.  I'd like to say that I'm PhD-free, and the setup went smoothly.  BUT...I also consider myself fairly comfortable with adding a variety of network devices to my wi-fi network.  Here's what you should know:<br /><br />1) If you just want to be able to access the camera from elsewhere on the same network (say, for example, you want to set the camera up in one end of the house, and monitor it from the other end), then setup is pretty straightforward.  The directions, though written in somewhat choppy English, walk you through the steps.  First, you connect the camera to your router using a wired connection, install some software for managing it, and then just follow the steps.<br /><br />2) ON THE OTHER HAND...if you want to be able to access the camera from outside of your network (say, you're away on vacation and want to monitor your house), the setup gets a little more technical.  If you've never been in the &#34;aministration area&#34; of your router, and if you are not familiar with what &#34;port triggering&#34; is, then you might want to find a friend or family member who knows that side of things.  The directions DO walk you through the process, but the process will vary depending on the router you have.  I'd like to say that patience will prevail, but I'm quite certain I know some people who would NOT be able to get this set up on their own, simply because they are used to devices that just plug in and work.<br /><br />3) One other point, for those who care about this: Most internet providers give most of their customers a &#34;dynamic&#34; IP address.  Or, put another way, most of us have an IP address that changes periodically.  This could make it tricky to access a device like this when you are away from home.  To Foscam's credit, they give you what is needed to work around this limitation.  My camera came with a 3-year unique domain that will allow me to access my camera, even though I have a regularly changing IP address.  Basically, they give me an address of the form xxxxxxxx.myfoscam.org.  The &#34;xxxxxxxx&#34; gets filled in with a domain identifier that is unique to my camera, and is stamped on the bottom of the camera.  There are other workarounds when faced with a dynamic IP address, and I will change to one of those once the three years are up.<br /><br />4) With the camera up and running (which took me about 15 minutes), I like how easy it is to access it.  From anywhere I want, I can monitor the camera, move the camera around, and configure the camera's settings.  The interface is a bit quirky sometimes (sometimes the controls don't work as expected, but mostly they do).  But all in all, I really like it.<br /><br />Be cautious about getting this camera if you are not comfortable learning to work with your router (unless you don't plan to access the camera when you are away from its network).  However, if you don't mind a little network configuration, this is really a great deal.is could make it tricky to access a device like this when you are away from home.

Thus far, I recommend this product.<br /><br />As for those of you talking about fake reviews: It's unlikely that they're fake, but they do walk you to Amazon and coach you through what comment on your review about. :)",03-12-2012

Easy to set up. No need for customer service calls. The video is great, the audio is great and the movement of the camera is quiet during operation. Other cameras when you pan and tilt you can hear the gears move, but with the foscam FI8910w you do not hear anything. So this is an advantage is you are checking in on your house. You do see the red IR leds but that can not be help. It is the technology of the IR leds.<br />Great remote operation, I use it on the iphone and it works flawlessly. You do need to buy the foscam app from the app store but it is worth it. I was able to check on my house when I was 8,000 miles away on vacation and I can tell you it was cool and comforting to check in.<br />You will need to know how to port forward your ports with you broadband provider which is easy enough for an average computer user. Also some free advice, if you are a verizon DSL user IT IS FREE TO PORT FORWARD YOUR PORTS. Verizon DSL tried to charge me 50 dollars a month to have my ports forwarded. They are ripoffs. They use a third party customer service to maintain their dsl routers. Just google any issues you may have and you will get your answers for FREE.",02-12-2012

They don't lie! This thing is great.<br />We have 2 iphones and an ipad, we use foscam pro to access the cameras from those devices (universal app). It gives full control of the pan and tilt and other settings on with the camera. It also transmits audio and allows you to talk through the camera; it doesn't have a great speaker, but our 2 year old seems to understand us well enough when talking through it. The app cost a few bucks (more than what I spend on most apps) but I knew how much a video baby monitoring system cost and we were still way under the cost of that route. As a side note, the app is a resource hog and will drain your battery. It will run in the background transmitting audio if you have it enabled. This really hasn't been an issue for me, it bugs my wife but she lets the app run forever.<br />The setup can be a little frustrating. Some things that help, assign it a static IP address so that if the router resets, it won't assign a different ip. We use port 8090 instead of 80; it seems to improve the reliability of our internet and its safer if you decide to set up port forwarding. I haven't gone through that step yet, but will get to it at some point. Follow the directions and it should go well. Be sure to give at least a minute (60 sec) if you are trying to have it list available networks.<br />The infrared is excellent, very clear in our baby's room. The glow of the red lights around the camera do not seem to bother her or prevent her from falling asleep. It is 10 times better than any baby monitoring system my friends use. As soon as I show them the clarity of the picture, they want to know exactly where to buy cause their sold. Happy monitoring!<br /><br /><Edit><br />I set up the port forwarding a week ago through my router - much easier than I expected it to be. On the port forwarding page on your router setup, you need to enter the port that it will be incoming on and type in the static ip address you have assigned to the camera. I used a random password generator to maximize the security of the password and changed it prior to setting up the port forwarding (hopefully this will increase the security). This now allows me to check in during nap time to see whats going on and we can move the camera to the main floor while away so we can check in on the house.<br />Really loving this camera, no it is not HD, but for our needs its great. I have now told several people about this camera who have purchased one for themselves including a friend whose wife just had a baby, a brother who has a one year old, and my parents who occasionally watch that one year old. All of them have had a similar positive experience.",29-11-2012

There are a few reviews on here that will help you with how to do all that, as well as a simple search on the Foscam site will also guide you through setup.<br /><br />I am able to view this camera pretty much anywhere I have an internet connection including anywhere I have a good signal on my Android phone using an IP Camera app.<br /><br />On a good connection, the camera is very responsive and can be controlled remotely to look around the room. It does work best if mounted upside down and up high if you are wanting to view an entire room. The night vision with IR lights works great at night and in dark rooms.<br /><br />In the more advanced set up, you can set it so it will email you a series of pictures if movement is detected.<br /><br />I do plan on purchasing at least one more for another part of the house when the price drops again and I am also looking at installing another Foscam branded camera outside to keep an eye on the front door.",28-11-2012

It can be viewed fullscreen on ipods, ipads, and phones and it works great on my wifes galaxy 3 as well.

Not a good product.,"I bought this product because it had the best reviews. Sadly, it also had a lot of bad reviews I should have heeded.<br /><br />Out of the box, everything seemed to work pretty well, except the wifi did not get a valid DHCP lease. Wired, it got a lease, no problem, so I just set up the wireless with a static IP address. (BTW, I am using SonicWall pro appliances and Cisco, *not linksys, WAPs)<br />---Strike 1: no DHCP on wireless<br /><br />OK - time to set it up and check night vision. OOPS! Guess what - these models suffer from sticky IR cut filters; just do a web search and you'll see what I mean. The \\""fix\\"" is to either power cycle the unit a few times or to flash a light at the sensor repeatedly until the filter solenoid un-sticks. Great... So basically I need to post a sign:<br /><br />\\""Hello potential burglar, this bouse is monitored by a security camera, but it's a bit crummy- could you please flash a flashlight 20 or so times at the light sensor until the solenoid clicks so we can make sure we are in night vision mode and can get a good picture of your face? Thanks, we really appreciate it.\\""<br /><br />---Strike 2: night vision doesn't work reliably<br /><br />Finally: Security. Oohhhh boy... This camera is not adequately securable. On an android phone (maybe other browsers, as well), connect to the camera, hit \\""cancel\\"" twice, and voila! you can now see information about the camera such as mac address, camera name, etc. Why would I EVER want to broadcast to the world any of this information???<br />---Strike 3: Oops! out of strikes, guess it's going back to Amazon.<br /><br />The ONLY reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the other features do work reasonably well.

I tried a D-Link 942L but the wireless range did not compare to this Foscam.  I was able to connect wirelessly through three walls to my courtyard and the connection was steady. For the money, this is a great camera.",21-11-2012

Assembly was very quick (30sec. tops). Now for those who do not have any computer experience it might be a little difficult to setup the port fowarding but its SOOOOO worth it. It took me an hour for the install and wireless set up. The port fowarding took a littel bit of research but I youtube'ed it and got it working very quickly. Now my father-in-law and mother in Oklahoma, and sister in Cali can see him all day if they would like. The online part is awesome! The admin can set up visitor accounts so that way you can restrict their capabilities, you can change the way you view the video, adjust sound and voice, and many many more things. The camera is very quiet when moving, my wife was right next to it holding the baby and she had no idea that I pointed it at her. The IR is amazing, we can see the picture perfectlly and I also love how it automatically swaps from regular to IR when the light reduces past a certain point in the room.",20-11-2012

So, other than price this thing is pretty much perfect and does exactly what it's advertised to do. One small advantage it has over the $50 unit is that the audio is quite a bit better, so if you're planning to use that feature a lot it might be worth springing for the FOSCAM, otherwise, I'd go with the WANSVIEW for half as much.",20-11-2012

From unboxing to full installation and Internet availability of the feed, it took approximately 30 minutes. The level of technical skill required is moderate, but if you are at all comfortable with port forwarding and DDNS, you will have no problem here. If you are not familiar with either of those areas, spend an hour researching them online and you will probably be able to muddle through fairly well.<br /><br />The video quality is excellent and I was pleasantly surprised by the night vision using the infrared LEDs. Probably a bit of overkill for a nursery monitor but the price is so much better than boxed solutions.

Set up did take some time, especially the configuration to access the camera outside of my home network.  Being able to view the camera while still within my home network was pretty easy to set up, just takes some basic understanding of how a home network works and also how to modify settings on your wireless router.  Camera is suprisingly sharp compared to what I expected and the night vision with the IR on is very good.  I was able to see everything in a 30x30 room off of my house without a single light on.  I purchased this camera for the purpose of keeping an eye on our new puppy while she is home alone for short periods of time, but think I may be purchasing a couple more to add to the network to allow me to keep an eye on the house when nobody is home.  The mounting bracket allows easy placement and I've actually retrofit mine with magnets so that I can stick it to any metal drywall corner in the house without drilling any holes.  The remote access works well too, although you have to be patient with the pan/tilt controls as there is a lag.  I was able to use a free ip cam viewer app for my android phone to remotely view the camera and have no trouble connecting to it.  All in all, a really nice camera for the price you pay.  Sure you can pay more for a higher quality unit, but for a basic setup that lets you keep an eye on your home this sure provides peace of mind.",15-11-2012

The setup on the camera while wired to our home router was a breeze.  It worked perfectly.  Once you unhook the camera from the network cable and try to set it up remotely, that's when all the problems begin.  The wireless feature on the camera is a joke... I was tempted to ask the dear boyfriend to drill holes into the floor so we could just hard wire the damn thing to the ceiling in our downstairs bedroom, but that was way too much work for a stupid webcam.<br /><br />My home network includes MAC address filtering so I included the MAC address on the NIC and the wireless MAC address(sticker on the bottom of the camera).  It had problems connecting just about everyday so I decided to just remove all the security measures on my router except a password.  I thought that would resolve the issue but I have concluded since that it's not my router.  I have to unplug the camera just about everyday and have it reconnect to my unsecure(in my eyes) network to get it to work.  If I forget to reset the camera, it will be just for show.

Linksys, and more recently Panasonic.  I wanted another camera for some outdoor monitoring, but the Panasonic had gone up to $299.  I was a little skeptical about a camera that only cost $88 but what the heck.  Well, it is a great little camera.  It pans and tilts further than the Panasonic, it has the IR night vision feature that the Panasonic does NOT have, and it was a breeze to install.  Basically, I installed it just fine without installing any software on my PC.  If you know how to determine the IP address that your router assigns, then that's all you need.  Plug it into your router (cable included) then find it's IP address.  Put that IP into your browser, and up pops the user interface.  The only thing you need is the default user and password which they give you in the quick-start guide.  After that you can configure it for wireless, disconnect it, reboot, and it comes up on your wireless net.  If that fails, just plug it back in and correct whatever mistake you may have made in the wireless setup.  Simple, cheap, feature packed.  What more can you ask?<br /><br />UPDATE:  Due to my good experience with this camera, I just bought another one (same model) at an even better price.  It dropped to $79, so I had to buy it.  The new one came with updated and better firmware and UI. It was equally easy to install and set up for multi-camera mode so I can monitor and control both cameras from one browser tab.  My only issue was it kept rebooting.  I discovered it was due to the DDNS settings.  I think it was trying to contact a DDNS server, my firewall blocked it, and so the camera would reboot and try again.  It was annoying, but I just set the DDNS to No-IP and now the problem is gone.  I love the IR night vision feature which has good range.<br /><br />UPDATE2:  I just bought my third camera.  I discovered that the price changes and varies from $99 to $79.  I just drop one in my \\""Save For Later\\"" area and wait until I see the price drop.  The third camera installed in under 5 minutes.  No software installed on my PC, just plug camera into the router, find the IP address that the router assigns it, HTTP to that address, and set it up.  It's the easiest, best price, and most features of any IP camera I've owned.  I will buy a fourth soon.<br /><br />UPDATE3:  I bought my fourth camera.

The picture quality is great, has a good lens viewing width, the ability to remotely control pan/tilt is a big plus, the \\""night vision\\"" works well, the motion capture alarming works well, & the wireless connectivity is solid and fast.<br /><br />The biggest negative for this camera is that the cameras webserver does not support HTTPS/SSL.  When accessing this camera from inside your network or the internet, your credentials will be passed in clear text. Also being that this camera connects to my home network wirelessly, someone sniffing my wireless traffic locally could get the credentials while I'm logging in as well.

I had no problems with the initial set up with ethernet able and then with moving on to wireless. However when it came to setting it up for remote online viewing I spent many, many hours without success. I did the router configuration , port forwarding and all the rest of that good stuff, and by the end of it I felt completely inadequate. I was never able to get around the port 80 blocking and forwarding, so I just decided to do the other forwarding....ie return it for a refund. I did enjoy the other functions of the camera but to me it was useless not being able to have access by connecting to it online via another computer when I am away from home, which is basically why I bought it.<br /><br />I think that Foscam has to make some improvements to their software and make it more of a plug and play device similar to other products on the market. Had I to do it over again, I would gladly pay another $50 and get a plug & play camera to start off with, rather than going through all this hassle.<br />So if you are not a computer whizz, I would not recommend this camera.",01-11-2012

The camera itself is a great concept, its easy to install the basics for this purpose and get it up and running.  Wi-Fi is a piece of cake to setup and the assembly is just plugging in and screwing he antenna in and mounting where desired.<br /><br />The infrared aspect of this camera is crucial because babies need dark rooms to sleep in and \\""night vision\\"" of other cameras always leaves a lot to be desired.  One tip is that you must have a very dark room with no bright spots for this to activate the IR lamps and so black outs on windows is a must.  The image is very clear though once activated.  Very happy with this aspect.<br /><br />The controls on this are a snap to use and very responsive and you can aim it anywhere and invert the image and controls etc incase you have it mounted upside down on the ceiling like we do.<br /><br />For actual monitoring we use Live Cam Pro from the iTunes app store on the Ipods and Ipads and the camera has instructions for a web based utility for use on Pc's.  Live Cam Pro is a great App to use.<br /><br />So you ask, having said all that, why 2 stars **.  Well there have been some problems with the cameras.  We are actually on our third replacement camera.  They are a great concept with great features but they are still very buggy even the latest version as of this review and customer service is a bit of a bear.  Here's some of the problems we have had with them.<br /><br />The audio is not great, there is a constant feedback humming which occurs on all devices, Ipods, Ipads and Pcs.  We spoke to Foscam about this and replaced the camera but the new one had the exact same problem and actually so does this third camera so I am not sure what they are achieving by having me get the camera replaced.  So the audio is not usable unfortunately especially when your trying to hear smallsubtle noises from a dozing baby.  Don't even consider the talk back feature as it results in an unstoppable squelch.<br /><br />The bigger problem was that the cameras were constantly rebooting themselves like there was a power outage.  I put them on different circuits and even connected it to a UPS battery backup to ensure it wasn't a power glitch here and it wasn't.  Half the time after reboots, it would have a new IP address which required reconfiguring the apps on a daily basis (sometimes in the middle of the night when baby is crying).  This requires you turning your pc on in the middle of the night to use the camera app to find the new IP address of the camera.  The other problem was that I would have to pan the camera etc to reposition back to where it was watching the baby before and this woke up the baby.  Sometimes on a reboot the camera would become stuck in the up position clicking trying to to go more up and I would have to enter the nursery to power cycle it to stop this and the clicking also wakes the baby.<br /><br />The biggest problem though was customer service.  There answer was always return the camera.  Now after 60 days from the initial purchase, you have to pay for shipping every time which has to be traceable like UPS and hence about $12.  So your paying $12 a pop for this.  Secondly I had to buy a replacement camera before returning the original camera so that I had a camera at all times and the replacement camera was more expensive.  Now you would think Foscam would refund the cost of the replacement camera, but no they refunded $11 less than the cost of the original camera resulting on me being another $23 out so I am $35 total out for every replacement.  Add that into your purchase price!!!  Subsequent to the replacements which still had the same problems, I did my own research and found some solutions myself which if Foscam had bothered to tell me would have saved them the replacement and me $35 a pop.  (audio still no good unfortunately and I have the latest rehash of the camera)<br /><br />So here I am with camera #3 hoping third times a charm but for much more than the original purchase price.  If I wasn't already invested in this camera (ITunes apps purchase etc) I would wish to have gone with a different camera or at least a different company.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />Update 12/9/12:<br /><br />Well third time is not a charm.  After a month of \\""ok\\"" use it has started resetting itself constantly like all the rest of the cameras.  This means I have to keep switching on my laptop to use the IP tool to see what the new IP address is of the camera before I can use it on the iPad and iPod.  A real pain at bedtime.  I don't feel like wasting more money returning this for an obviously defective product line.  Very dissappointed.  Given my experiences with these cameras and the unscrupulous customer service, I would be very wary of the good reviews this has received as possibly self written etc.",29-10-2012

The hardware is a breeze to setup but adjusting the wireless network/port forwarding and such is somewhat difficult if you do not know what port forwarding is. There are step by step video guides on foscam's main website to help ease the software setup. One problem I had was trying to view the camera through Internet Explorer. There was a problem with ActiveX not being able to download, but had that fixed from googling for troubleshoot guides online. This may not be the case for you but it can happen. Overall, I am happy with the camera for now.. So here is a list of what the camera provides, from what I can remember.<br /><br />Features:<br />-Theres an android app to view your camera from anywhere<br />-Pan/tilt from a click of your mouse (view distance is almost 360)<br />-Record function(Voice is recordable but the mic is not that great. Based on using the cameras program, you need to leave your computer on and you can only record when you view the camera through Internet Explorer. For some reason Internet Explorer have a few more options to mess with than running the camera through Chrome/Firefox/etc)<br />-IR bright enough<br />-Motion detector (Theres a Email function to send you photos/videos when triggered - You can also set the amount of secs the camera will record once the motion detector is triggered. There is also another function where the camera will save the video to a specific location in your computer once the motion detector is triggered)<br />-Horizontal/Vertical patrol (You are able to set how long the camera will pan left/right and tilt up/down throughout the whole time camera is active)<br />-Flip/Mirror<br />-Brightness/Contrast<br />-Able to set multiple users to view camera<br />-Audio (not that great though, there is an in/output on the back of the camera where you can place a better mic/speaker I am assuming, have not tried itthough)<br />-Speaker (You can speak in to your computer's mic and hear it on the camera. Only works when you run the camera program through Internet Explorer)<br />-Third party programs to run the camera (I have not tried this but you may have to pay for some of them after a trial, the programs are listed on their main website)<br /><br />I am going to purchase another and add on to this another review if any problems come up.<br /><br />Good luck with your purchases!",28-10-2012

I was nervous at first given some the reviewer comments about how difficult this can be to set up.  While I consider myself quite good with computers, I quickly develop a thousand yard stare when people start getting too far in to networks or router settings.  Despite the misgivings I ordered this model and it arrived in good order.  It took me about 15 minutes to be able to view it on my computer (within my own network).  Viewing it remotely on the Internet and my phone took about another 45 minutes.  Most of that time was wasted on trying to remember how to get back in to my router settings.  Once I got in to the settings, everything else was pretty much a breeze (despite having a less than desirable dynamic IP).  The two way audio didn't work right initially.  I could monitor the audio in the room but nobody could hear me on the other end.  This issue sort of just fixed itself after restarting my phone and rebooting the camera.<br /><br />No, I'm not a Foscam employee giving a fake 5 star review, as one previous reviewer claimed all five star raters were.  The video quality is a bit fuzzier than I expected, there's no zoom function, and the internal speaker for the two way audio stinks because the volume is so low.  If there is anyone talking in the room or a television is on, don't expect them to be able to hear you.  Despite that I'm still willing to give it a 5 star rating because it's a heck of a lot of \\""bang for the buck.\\""  If I wanted something that was perfect I'd probably have had to spend a lot more money so I can't complain.  My recommendations for set up are to simply follow the instructions line by line.  That's what I did and outside of the audio problem at the beginning, it worked fine.

I found that between the two I was able to have a painless installation. The F19910W is quite bulky and I purchased the Black one which seem to be very well made and sturdy (and weighty) in construction. This is not a web cam that you will easily hide and you need to think along the lines of disguising it's profile somehow.<br /><br />The cameras performance is very good and pans and tilts to the software commands very well.You can also listen to sound in it's vicinity and it has a small speaker in which you can speak through, although the level of sound is quite low.I downloaded and installed IP Cam Viewer Pro by Robert Chou both on my Ipad and also on my Android Nook. This is the icing on the cake as the software enables you to control the Web Cam very well and i highly recommend it.<br /><br />The price has gone up $10 since I purchased the web cam which is rather annoying as I was considering purchasing another but will wait until they are on sale.Overall a good purchase and allows us the ability to view our home when we are away and also to get email alarms if we arm the motion sensing. There is also the ability to take a snapshot and record video too. Just bear in mind this is a web cam and not a professional high quality surveillance camera. For value for money it is pretty good but it would seem they are pushing up the price.<br /><br />Unfortunately mine had or developed a sound problem where the sound was distorted and weak. A call to Amazon and the item was replaced. All is well with the replacement camera though it's software was not the same as that which comes with the \\""white model\\"" hoping that Foscam has released the software update for the camera's UI as they said it would be available in Jan 2013.

The software for the camera works great and it has all the features I needed. The only problem is the IR-CUT (the camera's ability to switch between night and day mode) is flawed. There seems to be some mechanical piece in there that changes around when things go dark to allow the camera to see in IR. My camera worked fine for about a week then stopped responding to the light in the room, permanently staying in \\""day\\"" mode. I could manually switch it if I went into the software but that was about it. I went online in hopes of solving my own problem but found many people were having the same issue. It would appear this is a factory defect and not some sort of user error. I contacted Foscam's tech support and got the usual power cycle talk but that didn't fix anything.

It doesn't even allow you to select the frequency of or the number of photos it takes. In testing it, I found that you often miss what you really want to see.

I read all of these peoples complaints on here and these are my thoughts. First let me say for -100. dollars you cant go wrong with this camera. As far as people stating that foscam has no support, im sure they dont because they are nothing more than some chinese teenagers making really cheap cameras and selling them on the internet. Dont expect support. Also people complain they are to hard to set up. This is true if you have no knowledge of routers, ip addresses, or port forwarding. Some people write these reviews using the correct terminology but they still dont have a clue what they are doing. I see them saying that the wifi doesnt work on them. Thats because they were to stupid to find the button in the gui to turn it on. One guy said you have to get a subscription to a dns service. You dont. he doesnt know what he is doing either. You could call your isp and get static ip's for less than 20 a month or just deal with it when your ip changes. If you have at&t uverse it never does unless a tech changes equipment. Finally I will wrap this up by saying that you dont check into a motel 6 and expect a mini bar with 5 star room service. If you want a 5 hundred dollar camera, than go buy one.

The software is the real problem.  The software is primarily written for Internet Exlporer and does not work well with Chrome or other browsers.  For remote access you need to set up port forwarding and run software that will convert your dynamic Internet address into a static address. If you want to record, you need to have a FTP server available.  What a pain!

The email setup was slightly harder. A quick google search and I was able to find some info from the foscam user community. If you have comcast and the outlook email program then you can get emails directly to your phone if you choose to activate the motion detection. It is an awesome feature! When it detects something moving it will take pictures in intervals of zero through whatever seconds you want it to and send them to your phone.

I would also like to add that if you wanted to view it outside of your wireless network that you would need to set up a ddns account. no-ip.com(you will need to update your firmware/webui) or dlinkddns.com are the best options since they're free.

Very few and simple changes to router and camera to make it reliable i.e static lan ip, take lan ip out of pool, have camera email you new wan if it changes. Infrared shuts off when lights come on. Remote control from phone. May step up to the paid app which adds audio down the road. Cool toy for me to tinker with and learn.<br /><br />Update 1: Just be forewarned that the audio is distorted and pretty much unusable. Still not a show stopper for me but figured I'd pass this on for someone using it as a baby monitor. I had the same issue on a $125 cisco/linksys ip camera i tried a year or 2 ago. Heard it could be several causes which i'll investigate but even if it doesn't work i'll still keep it. Heard i may not have this issue using the android app but you have to pay for that feature. Report back if I discover a fix.<br /><br />Update 2:Thanks for the heads up on the audio. I just discovered the same thing this morning - \\""enable and disable the mic like a walkie talkie\\"". Think it's probably software related. Maybe why they sell the blue iris software as an accessory. See if I can find some reports about if using the blue iris software eliminates the problem. You saved me some time by testing with external mics and speakers. Thank You. Have not tried the audio on my phone yet as it would require me to pay for the app - IP Cam viewer by Robert Chou. Please report back if you come up with a solution and I'll do the same.<br /><br />Posted the above comment to another reviewer who delved deeper. Appears all is not lost for the audio. May take this into the discussion section. I tested this morning from my pc at work. The camera is right next to my pc at home so I think that is why i have more issues at home with feedback.",18-10-2012

Is it a great camera in terms of resolution and frame rate?  Not really.  But is it a great camera in terms of its price?  Absolutely.  You won't find better \\""bang for the buck\\"" at this price point.<br /><br />First the good:<br />(1)  It is very inexpensive; you'll be hard-pressed to find so many features at this price in other low-end cameras.<br />(2)  Construction quality is very good; the camera seems sturdy and well-built.<br />(3)  WiFi range is excellent - I am having no problems getting a good image anywhere in my house.<br />(4)  PTZ gives you almost 360 degrees of view if you rotate from one extreme to the other.<br />(5)  The built-in infrared diodes are bright enough to easily illuminate an entire room for nighttime viewing.<br />(6)  You get a nice screw-in mount and a convenient retractable Ethernet cable bundled with the camera.<br /><br />Now the not-so-good:<br />(1)  The camera lens has significant \\""fish eye\\"" distortion.<br />(2)  With a 640 x 480 pixel resolution, you're not going to be getting a good picture of an intruder's face unless he gets fairly near the camera in good lighting conditions.  If you need a higher-resolution image, you're going to have to spend more money on a better camera.<br />(3)  The effective frame rate is not that high - maybe 3 to 5 fps if you're watching an image from outside your home network.<br />(4)  The audio quality from the built-in speaker and microphone is adequate, but not very impressive.  You can hear what's going on through the camera, and be understood at the other end, but it's like talking through a long stovepipe.  On the other hand, it is more than adequate for a baby monitor.<br />(5)  It is a pain to set up unless you know what you're doing.<br /><br />Fortunately, at least for Mac users, it's not that hard to configure it once you know the trick.  Here is what to do, assuming you have a Mac laptop and a wireless home router with at least one free Ethernet port:<br /><br />(1)  Copy over FOSCAM's \\""IP Camera Tool\\"" app onto your Mac.  You can either copy it from the bundled CD, or download it from the FOSCAM site.<br /><br />(2)  Now open System Preferences on your Mac, and click on the Network icon.  When the network window opens, click on the Wi-Fi tab (if it's not already selected) and click the \\""Advanced\\"" button in the lower right hand corner of the window.<br /><br />(3)  In the new window that appears, click the \\""TCP/IP\\"" tab.  Write down the Subnet Mask and Router IP addresses, and then close System Preferences window.<br /><br />(4)  Now here's the tricky part:  you have to decide which IP address on your router you want to reserve for the camera.  For example, if your Router IP address is 10.0.1.1, you'll want to change the last number to use as your camera IP address, e.g. 10.0.1.61 or 10.0.1.100 for the camera.  However, you don't want to re-use an existing address that the router has already allocated.  You have two choices:  either log in to your router and check which addresses are being currently allocated, or just pick a number between 2 and 255 at random, e.g. 10.0.1.61, and see if it works.  Obviously these numbers may be different depending on the router.  For example, if your Router IP address is 192.68.2.1, then you can try 192.68.2.61 or 196.68.2.100 for the camera.<br /><br />(5)  Turn off your Mac's Wi-Fi connection.  Plug the camera into your Mac's Ethernet port using the supplied cable, but don't connect the camera's AC adapter yet.<br /><br />(6)  Start the IP Camera Tool app.  An empty window will open on your desktop.  Now turn on the camera by plugging in its AC adapter.  After about 20 seconds, the camera will begin to rotate through its start-up sequence.  At that point, you'll get several socket error warnings from the IP Camera Tool.  Click through these errors, and you'll finally get back to the IPCamera Tool window, which will show an Anonymous device (this is the camera) with an incorrect subnet error message, asking you to double-click to fix it.<br /><br />(7)  When you double-click the message in the window, a small window will open.  For the IP address, fill in the address you've chosen for your camera.  For the Subnet Mask, use the same number you wrote down earlier.  For Gateway and DNS Server, fill in the Router IP address you wrote down earlier.<br /><br />(8)  Leave the password field blank, with user \\""admin\\"".  Click OK.<br /><br />(9)  The camera will restart.  After it has restarted, you'll start getting socket error warnings again.  Ignore them, unplug the camera, and quit the IP Camera Tool app.<br /><br />(10)  Now use the Ethernet cable to plug the camera into an unused Ethernet port on your router.  Plug in the AC adapter and wait for the camera to restart.<br /><br />(11)  Turn on your laptop's WiFi again.  Open the Safari browser and type in the IP address you chose for the camera, e.g. the http prefix followed by 10.0.1.61.<br /><br />(12)  If you did everything right, you'll be able to log in to the camera's built-in web server and configure it using the Device Management tab.  Specifically, you can scan for a wireless network list under \\""Wireless LAN Settings\\"", select your own home network, enter the password, and click the box labeled \\""Using Wireless LAN\\"".  Click Submit and the camera will restart again.<br /><br />(13)  Now unplug the camera from the router.  Again, use your Safari browser to access the IP address of the camera (you may have to close and re-open the Safari window).  If your wireless connection is working, you'll be able to log in to the camera again, and make any other configuration changes that you want.<br /><br />If you want to use your camera outside of your home network, you'll need to learn about port forwarding.  I won't go into that, because it is dependent on the router, but for my cameras I use port 80 for the internal port of each camera, and ports 8101 through 8104 for my external ports, respectively.  It works fine, and I can watch my home over my iPhone without any difficulty.<br /><br />As a final note, I strongly recommend that you buy the Foscam Pro app for your iPhone / iPad.  The same app will work for both (you only need to buy it once), and it will give you complete control over the camera, including access to the audio features.Camera Tool window, which will show an Anonymous device (this is the camera) with an incorrect subnet error message, asking you to double-click to fix it.<br /><br />(7)  When you double-click the message in the window, a small window will open.

Not for critical applications, but for monitoring a grandmother or baby - it's great! I am using two of these cameras right now.<br /><br />Setup<br /><br />Not easy to set the camera up to the WiFi and get all the settings right. Honestly I don't think ANY WiFi camera would be easy given all that you ask it, but don't think it will be easy for the novice. I wanted to access the camera from the open internet so needed to fix it's IP address and do some Port Mapping with my router - don't know what that means? Not the fault of the camera, it's just complicated and the software of the camera doesn't help. Once it is set up, it seems stable.<br /><br />Ease of Use<br /><br />The camera has a built in web interface. Really bad and simplistic. I think another reviewer said it was made in 1989. Probably right ;) HOWEVER, I access it with an iPad app (Foscan Pro: Two Way Audio and Recording) and it is great! Has motion sensing, control, audio, etc. The app is not great, but better than the other ones I have tried. That plus the camera and I've got a system that we use 24/7 with two or more cameras. Sort of (read about stability).<br /><br />Stability<br /><br />One reason I don't think the Foscam is for professional monitoring is that it gets lost every-so-often. It acts like it goes through a reset and a boot up. So if you are in the room and watching or listening to the motion sensing, then you will catch it and re-aim it. If not, you come back and the camera is staring at the ceiling.<br /><br />I have one camera that takes it one step further and crashes. It crashes about once a day - no response at all and I need to go and unplug and replug it in to get it back to normal. The warrantee claims two years and I am going to send it back for a replacement - but when you go to the Foscam website they offer no support if you didn't buy it from them - correction, the Foscam website was also built in 1989 and by folks that don't know about customer service, so maybe you can get help - I gave up.<br /><br />Amazon has issues me an RMA so I will be a happy camper.<br /><br />All-in-all I would buy again. I like the audio monitoring that comes free. MUCH better with the iPad/iPhone app.",10-10-2012

Yes, please!","I bought this specifically to use as a baby monitor, so if that's not your intention for it, you don't need to read further.<br /><br />I spent a lot of time researching baby monitors when I started to come across wireless network cameras.  Brilliant!  The idea of being able to view from my computer/smartphone/iPad was appealing since one of these things is usually near.  That means I don't have to carry around a video monitor unit that I have to worry about being charged or losing or whatever.  Plus, it means my husband can spy on the baby from work, too :)<br /><br />The Foscam seemed to have pretty good reviews overall, so we decided to give it a shot.  The price far beats some of the top-rated video baby monitors and offers viewing flexibility that a technologically savvy family can appreciate.<br /><br />Without further adieu, here's my quick break-down:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Love the ability to view baby from multiple devices.  There are several options for apps on both IOS and Android for viewing on this camera.<br />- Infrared works GREAT.  I can get clear views of my daughter from her nearly-pitch-black bedroom.<br />- Infrared lights are very dim and not too distracting (though I don't have experience with other infrared lights...just saying that they're not super-bright or an issue in a baby's room)<br />- Totally silent adjusting.  Yes, this camera is all ninja when you're panning around the room.  The only times it makes noises is when the infrared goes on/off, it makes a quiet clicking sound.  Otherwise, it's quiet enough to give you the confidence that it will NOT wake a baby when you adjust it.<br />- Wireless feature allows for you to use without being hooked up to a computer--something a regular webcam cannot deliver in this situation.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Set up (as many have mentioned) can be a PAIN.  If you are not familiar with tinkering with your router settings and all that, I'd say get help from someone who does.  I consider myself to be intermediate with technology, and when following the instruction manual, I got frustrated.  My husband finished the job quickly.  Though, when we got a new internet service provider, he had a more difficult time when a new modem/router came into play and it took him quite a while longer to get that figured out.<br />- It's big and ugly.  I can't lie, it's not the prettiest thing to have in your baby's room and certainly much bulkier and less aesthetically pleasing than a lot of baby video cameras...but you sacrifice beauty for functionality.  You'll soon forget about that when you're giggling at your ridiculous baby's antics in clear view.<br />- I'm not sure why, but we have issues with it regularly resetting.  (You know this because when it resets, it runs through a series of panning around and will finally stop at a pre-designated position which is always pointing away from the baby's crib).  Sometimes this happens multiple times a day, sometimes we go days without it happening.

All the actual \\""video baby monitors\\"" I thought were way overpriced and most had poor/mixed reviews. I have had this camera for a week now and I absolutely LOVE it as a baby monitor. It was a piece of cake to set up; only took me about about 15 minutes. I'm not a computer genius but I'm no dummy either. I installed the camera program (from the included disk) on my laptop and then downloaded an app to my iPad. (In the App Store I searched \\""foscam\\"" and several baby monitor apps were available.) I put the camera right above the top of my son's crib. The camera captures the entire crib space and gives a nice, clear picture. The night vision is also perfectly clear. The color quality is good. When viewing on my iPad, I can see my 5 month old son's back rising and falling as he breathes (sleeps on his tummy).<br /><br />I have not tried to do the remote/internet viewing but would like to try that soon. I'm afraid it will be difficult to do.<br /><br />The only drawback is the power cord to the camera is too short (I just use a small extension cord). There is no zoom either, but you definitely don't need it if you are using it as a baby monitor. If you could spend $10 more and get one with zoom and maybe more megapixels then I would do it.<br /><br />Fantastic camera for a baby monitor.

Finding apps that automatically work fine with this was probably toughest part (for sharing w/ Android/Iphones). I have IP Cam Viewer for Android, and Baby Monitor for Iphones. I'd write down how to share, but its different from either app. From IP Cam Viewer you right click the app (FREE), click MORE, click Share, and enter the phone number. Youd need to give them your credentials as well.<br /><br />I knocked a star off as i had to FIND apps it worked with, then its GUI is far from intuitive. I should knock off another star for their horrible, err non existing support, not that I needed it. Its the way it is these days, they knock out support, while keeping their price up.  Not only that, but they justify it. Everyone cuts service out of the budget.

I am a little bit tech savvy but not a whole lot. Spent more than 5-6 hours on this camera set up, I think it is just a waste of time. My by a Ph.D computer scientist can get this working but then that person can make his own camera as well. This is not a camera for anbody who works in a non-IT industry. I am having serious issues connecting to the camera for outside the network; that was the whole reason that I bought it for. The instructions are very poor and do not elaborate on some of the biggest internet providers like Verizon, Comcast etc.<br /><br />Just been a very frustrating weekend. If Foscam is listening, they should do somthing about the set up.",08-10-2012

In fact I looked around for a few months before finally deciding to give these a try.<br /><br />All of the people saying they work in IT and still can't figure these cameras out.. get a new job, or don't lie (I really do work in IT). I went the wired route, but I don't think I'd have any more trouble with the wireless.<br /><br />To set these up, I do recommend knowing about router and port forwarding (if you plan on viewing these on the go.) To get the basics up.. just plug the camera into your router (or I used a switch.) The cd foscam package's with the camera comes with a tool that will detect the IP address of the camera. Or, like I did, went to my router to find it.  Then simply type the address into your browser (I will warn IE often is finicky about typing in IP addresses, so try chrome if you have problems.)  The camera has a built-in web-server, once you type in the address and install the active x plugin (for IE, but you can use other browsers) everything you need is there.<br /><br />I bought two of these to use in the kids' room.  They work perfectly for this. Night vision works well.<br /><br />In regards to using this from outside your network.. the instructions come with a so-so guide on how to use port forwarding.  Its really not all that difficult, my router has instructions on the port forwarding page as well. As for dynamic IP addresses, well for that you do need no-ip or some other service. However, I have cable internet.. and I can't tell you the last time my IP changed so for me it isn't an issue. But don't be too afraid of those services, there are reputable companies out there that have no relations with foscam and don't care to spy on your cameras.<br /><br />Edit:  For the people claiming the 5 star reviews are fake,  I can assure you this one is not. Unless these cameras suddenly die, I am very happy with them. I think a lot of people get frustrated because they cannot set them up and unfairly rate this product down and assume all the good reviews are fake.<br /><br />UPDATE: 1-29-13  Dropped rating from 5 star to 1 :(<br />I bought two more of these cameras a couple days ago because I loved the first two so much.  Well the two new ones came with new firmware YAY! (NOT!).  While the cameras still seem to work just fine, Foscam has included a new \\""feature\\"". They have their own DDNS service built into the camera now.  Which, this would be fine and dandy except its very difficult to disable. There is no option to do this ANYWHERE in the admin panel. The only way is to issue a cgi command via the browser (there is a post how to do this on the foscam forums.)  However, if you don't disable this before connecting it to your network.. too late because foscam already has your ip and has the DDNS service set-up. You can change the port and then the myfoscam url won't be able to access it directly, but if someone wanted to try and guess your port, presto.  Why? Because UPnP is turned on by default now, which forwards the port automatically.<br /><br />I'm not feeding into the conspiracy theories about Foscam wanting to spy on you, rather, I think they made these changes to make things easier to set-up and manage.  But for me, I knew how to set-up and use these so it creates an unnecessary security risk.<br /><br />Foscam: MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO DISABLE THE DDNS SERVICE AND TO REMOVE MY IP FROM YOUR SERVICE AND I'LL CHANGE MY RATING BACK TO FIVE STARS.<br /><br />Edit: 5-1-13  Back to 4 stars<br />Foscam has made it possible to disable their DDNS service.  I decided not to change my review back to 5 stars because of the hassle this has caused.  Plus, I think their DDNS service is still enabled by default, which I don't like.<br />All 4 cameras are still going strong.",08-10-2012

Low image quality.  Further than 25ft, faces can't be distinguished .  Maybe a focus problem?<br />2. Software only allows recording with Windows Internet Explorer (viewing and controlling still work with other browsers)<br />3. IR LEDs are visible to the naked eye as glowing red.  So this camera can't be hidden<br />4. No option to turn the IR LEDs and keep the IR filter off.<br />5. Software glitches, Admin password couldn't be changed and static IP address couldn't be used<br /><br />In detail:<br />1. There is no auto focus on this camera, so maybe I have to manually screw the lens to focus on objects further than 25 feet.  But if something comes closes then it will be out of focus again, so why bother.  Or maybe the camera is low quality.  It does state .3 mega pixels on the camera lens.<br /><br />2. While you can't record without IE, you can set the camera to send 6 images to your email if it senses motion.<br /><br />3. The IR LEDs work great!!!  But they're visible and I'm trying to be sneaky and catch someone who keeps letting their dog shit on my yard at night.  IR (infrared light) is suppose to be invisible to the naked eye.<br /><br />4. The camera has a light sensor that turns the IR LEDs and disengages the IR filter.  For your info, IR filters need to be removed for \\""night vision\\"" to work.  Cameras come with IR filters to block out IR light which ruin color photos and videos.  In fact most cameras can be turned into night vision cameras by opening them up and removing the IR filter.  If you turn the IR LEDs off, the camera thinks it's daylight and engages the IR filter, preventing from working at night. You can put tape over the LEDs, but I have my camera behind tint, and the IR LEDs still managed to \\""leak\\"" and cause a reflection off the tint in recorded video (not to the naked eye though).  So I had to take the camera apart and remove the LEDs and unplug the IR filter actuator.<br /><br />5. When I change the Admin password, I can never log back into my camera.  I talked to some people who had this problem and some that haven't.  Random problem?  I also can't assign a static ip address in my router for this camera.  If I do, the camera never connects to my router.IR filter actuator.<br /><br />5. When I change the Admin password, I can never log back into my camera.

If you need an IP cam with video streaming to Android and iproducts, this is your best non-professional product.

I asked for any other options, because I work 7:30-6:00 every day and live 40 mins from my office.  No other option. The next day I took a long lunch, cam home and called.  Again after a 20 min wait on hold, heavily accented person ask the same questions and then he said that he needed my phone number to have the technician call me within the next two hours.  Told him that I would be boxing these cameras back up and sending them back, because this was not right.  He asked if he could schedule a call back to me first thing Saturday morning, because they are open 9-6 for support on Saturdays. I told him that would be fine.  No call as of 1pm on Saturday.

Cons I have encountered so far:  I haven't gotten the sound to work (on Mac Safari -- I may have also tried Mac Firefox, but nothing else), so the features and where these features are supported could be clearer.  No https (SSL) over the world wide web.  (I confirmed with Foscam).  Amazonian 2082 said, \\""Anyone else have a sneaky suspicion that someone in (guess where?) is looking at what I'm looking at?\\"".  Without https, more people than you think could be looking.  The work around I have yet to try is to use additional hardware to setup a secure SSL https connection over the www to indirectly connect to the camera inside the LAN, rather than port forwarding the camera directly.  No ability to turn off \\""infrared in use\\"" lamps, so that could draw unwanted attention to the camera.  Significant click noise when you switch to/from infrared.    Pros:  Pretty quiet when rotating.  Another reviewer supplied a link to the SDK.  Infrared picked up dust particles floating in my home which I did not see in color mode nor with my naked eye, so that prompted me to improve my home air quality.

I finally decided to give it a try and made the purchase last week.  Now, I'm no network guru nor am I totally new to logging in to my router and making some adjustments.  I also played with my network and got it to where I can share and view all of my 4 laptops and 1 HTPC in the house and that's the extent of my network knowledge.<br /><br />I started my adventure at 7pm by hooking up the camera to the router and immediately found the IP address using my router login (I have uVerse all in one).  The CD software simply acquires cam IP address for you so it's definitely not needed if you know how to look around your router.  The issue I had was that I don't know if it was my network or my macbook or dell laptop but it was extremely slow.  I had to play around the adjustments, rebooting this and that and couldn't get anything.  But eventually, after taking a break and trying a different port, it finally came up!  I was then able to enter my wireless information and port forwarding.  I was able to view this camera using my home IP address, which is very cool!  Now another issue came when I unplugged the camera - for whatever reason, it would not work just on my wireless network!  Very frustrating.  This is where I am right now, trying to troubleshoot this issue.  Even with all this issue, I think this camera is definitely worth it.  Night vision is simply mind blowing.  Having said that, I'll probably get two more and place them around the house.  I'm probably going to build a home surveillance system using few of these cameras and two USB web cams that I have which will make it a very effective at a minimal cost.<br /><br />**EDIT** **10/26/2012**<br />The reason why I had such difficult time to get this camera connected wifi was because I have MAC filtering on my network and the Foscam cameras come with two MAC addresses of which both are on the bottom of the device.  Make sure you get those two MAC addresses entered if you have MAC filtering.  This setup would have taken me minutes if it wasn't for that.  Also, I'm using iCam and ipCam viwer and have it set up on no-ip.org.  I simply love this camera, I'm going to have another one to use as my baby monitor.  I also have two USB cameras (Logitech and Microsoft) connected to my HTPC and they work pretty well when there's light but the Foscam works especially well when even it's pitch dark with the IR.",03-10-2012

Two problems I encountered while setting my Foscam up (on a windows computer): (1) If you use Internet Explorer, be prepared to disable your security settings, ie. Firewall, Anti-Virus, etc.; because you will need to install ActiveX for your camera work; for my windows computer, it would not allow me to install ActiveX no matter what I did. (2)If you use Mozilla Firefox you will not need to install ActiveX, but you will not be able to record; an outside software would need to be installed on your computer; I would recommend using Vitamin-d.com, but that wouldn't work on my computer either.  Another problem I had with Foscam was there Customer Support; DO NOT BOTHER CALLING THEM, they will NOT pick up.  Your best bet would be to email them; this is due to the fact that they are in India.  Not to say they aren't helpful, but it takes a while to get in contact with them.  The last problem I had with the Foscam is the night vision setting, if you plan on installing the Foscam inside your home, office, etc. pointing outside your window, the lights on the front of the Foscam will reflect; so the image you will see on your Foscam will be a circle of small lights.  If you do decide to buy this product and return it back to Amazon.com, they will charge you to return the product, so make sure this is what you want.  Thank you.",21-09-2012

I don't regret that so far.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Set up was easier than some reviews led me to believe. From a Mac OS perspective, the included CD only had a very simple utility that finds the IP address of the camera. There are plenty of other ways for the computer-savvy to find that address as well. Plug the camera into your router, type that IP into your web browser and you get full controls. From there, you can enable the wireless, turn on the motion alarm, etc.<br /><br />- The quality is surprisingly good. I generally leave it at the 320px resolution because the motion is smoother.<br />- When the camera moves and tilts, it's very quiet. Since like I said we're using it for a baby monitor, that's important.<br />- There are numerous iOS and Android apps out there. Even searching \\""Foscam\\"" in the store will bring up plenty of results.<br />- I haven't had to deal with support yet, but Foscam's website has a lot of good information in their user forums. It's a popular enough camera that there are a lot of other forums out there with people talking about them and working through issues.<br /><br />CONS:<br />I can't get audio to work through a web browser, unless you're using Windows with Internet Explorer. This is due to Foscam (for some reason) using Videolan's lapsed web plugins which I just can't get to work. Streaming the camera directly from Videolan's open-source VLC app will give you sound though on Mac, Windows, or Linux. Since I don't normally need to use the controls for the camera, I usually just stream it that way. I also downloaded a couple iOS apps that have both sound and controls.<br /><br />- There is a delay with audio of about a second. How you feel about that probably depends on how you're going to use the camera.<br /><br />Overall, I haven't had it for too awfully long but my impression is very good.",20-09-2012

I was able to successfully setup the camera wired and wireless without any problems. I don't have any background with networking configuration at all but I do admit, the instructions included need to be a little bit more detailed. I assigned a permanent ip through my router (I have AT&T U-verse/2wire) and had to reboot my router after connecting the camera through ethernet for setting up wireless since the wireless ip address did not show automatically in my devices list-the foscam camera has two different ip addresses for the wired and wireless, important to note that). And I was able to remotely access the camera in my ipad and iphone through the $5 app as well as hosting it through No-ip for free after updating the firmware to the latest. To access outside of my local network like when I'm at work, all I need to do is type my external ip address with the opened port on the browser to access the camera. I'm thinking of upgrading my no-ip membership to the $9.95 a year one for a more-hassle free dynamic dns.<br /><br />For port-forwarding, I created a rule to host port 8090 through my router and so far no problems. I created usernames and password for family members who are overseas  and assigned them as \\""visitors\\"" in the user settings and they were able to access the camera using my external ip address and port just fine.<br /><br />Quality of the image is alright for the price.

The night vision is amazing. The microphone is very sensitive - maybe too much so, as I have to turn the volume down a click or two on my iphone so I don't hear the background noise. We're using a foscam app on the iphone and we use it as the monitor. You can pan the camera, speak through the camera and record video through it. You can also set it up to run in the background like a phone call, so you can use it as an audio monitor (and it doesn't suck the battery life of the phone as quickly). You can still receive a phone call (it just kills the app). So far it looks like just under an hour of constant audio and video up on the iphone screen used about 25% of my battery. When I put it in the background so I just heard the audio constantly (the screen was off) for over an hour and a half it used about about 15% of my battery. You can use your browser to monitor the video, as well, but on the mac, there is an issue of the audio not working in the browser. When on the computer I use the application VLC to monitor the audio and video. It works well, but of course, you can't use the camera controls (move the camera) or speak through the camera.<br />So, it has its flaws, but for what we're using it for, it is pretty awesome and much cheaper than a lot of the better video baby monitors.",16-09-2012

Although the reviews here are very positive, the comments led me to believe this was a cheaply made product, albeit at a good price point.  My take is a bit different...  I am very impressed with the build quality and the performance of this camera.  Just for reference, an Axis PTZ camera will set you back about $1200 dollars (12 times the price).  While the Foscam camera lacks a zoom feature, it has self contained invisible night illumination and the Axis does not.<br /><br />If you are using the camera for home or office where the distances are reasonable (as opposed to a warehouse or big box store where you need to zoom in on a shoplifters hands), this is your camera.  The 24 hour ir illumination will cover a room or hallway nicely at night when the room lights are out.<br /><br />The product came nicely protected and included a CD with mac and pc instructions, a paper easy start guide, a sturdy adjustable bracket for wall ceiling or tabletop mounting, and a neat retractable spool ethernet cable.

Mounting the holding bracket was fast (two screws) and with the vertical flip option, we chose the upper corner and did an upside down installation. This gives us much more coverage and viewing angle of the whole room, so we can even see the baby and follow him around when he's playing outside the crib.<br /><br />Image quality decent, it gives 320x240 and 640x480 resolution, which is enough to be used as a monitor. The management section of the Real-Time Camera Monitoring System offers many more options than what we need so I can't comment on those characteristics.<br />The night vision capabilities and quality of IR are nothing short of AMAZING (I realized this as in the monitor the image was incredibly clear and lit, but when I stepped into the room it was completely pitch dark, I couldn't see my own hands). The IR light do make a clicking sound when they come on or off, but nothing that would be disturbing. We have the camera connected with Ethernet cable (we tried the wireless option and worked great also) but on the flip side for us, the connectivity lights behind the base unit create little distraction at night for the baby. As it's not intended to be a silent Baby monitor, we can't really complain about this, just a note.<br /><br />Overall, this was an excellent purchase, we even have set it to broadcast outside our LAN, so image can be shared with others through a web address. We are even considering purchasing more of this model or it's subsequent upgrades in the future, to serve as a security system for our house.",10-09-2012

Until I purchased this camera, I'd simply have no idea if my house was broken into, flooded, etc. until I'd return home and find out for myself. The peace of mind is easily worth the $100 price tag. I've got it set to show the entryway, with the motion alarm armed. So far, it's worked as advertised. Initially I got a few false motion alarms, but I've enabled motion compensation and reduced the sensitivity slightly. Seems to be working fine.<br /><br />Yes, setup is kind of a beast if you're not familiar with networking. I didn't have to contact tech support over it, but I'm fairly tech savvy and know how my router operates. If I can offer two suggestions that may or may not work for every router:<br /><br />1. Change the camera's default port. It defaults to 80, which is the standard HTTP port used for websites. For some reason, no matter how much I worked at it, my router would not accept inbound connections on port 80 to the camera. I changed it to a random port, and it works fine. This can be done under the \\""Basic Network Settings\\"" menu. That leads me to the next point...<br /><br />2. Enable UPnP in the camera settings. For me, I didn't have to set up any type of port forwarding once the router recognized the camera.<br /><br />My IP address is static, which reduces the complexity. No DNS issues to deal with.<br /><br />Overall, pretty much exactly what I expected for the cost. 4 stars only for the difficult setup.",09-09-2012

This unit had newer firmware, but I still needed to update it to the current version on the Foscam website. The web ui still does not work correctly on Chrome (three years and no changes?) and I could only use IE 8 on WinXP or IE10/11 on Win8.1 to properly get the active-x plugin to install. IE11 on Windows 10 did not work for me.   On top of that, the picture quality of this newer version of the FI8910W is not as sharp as the older model I have (which still works as I don't have it plugged in all the time so it hasn't had a chance to burn out). They kinda went backwards in quality and lowered the price a little.    I knocked my review another star for lack of update to this model for browser support and for poor picture quality. You wouldn't know the picture was bad unless you had another unit to compare it to. Now for my use, I just needed a way to see if I had a package outside my door or if someone was knocking or ringing door bells while I was upstairs. I have it installed under an eave that is dry. For that purpose it is ok. Forget trying to grab screen shots or clips with any detail for security use as everything is pretty much blurry or choppy (frame rate issue). For that you might want to try the 960p FI9821W or the Amcrest 1080p model at twice the price of this unit.    Note: I used the Foscam software on the CD to find the camera on my DHCP network and immediately set a static IP and turned on wireless for all other configuration. Using a LAN cable directly to the unit is the best way to get it up and running and configured before power down and placement/install. (I used a powerline ethernet adapter to make life easy as I have powerline in the house).   -------------------------- original review from 2012  I've had the FI8910W for one week. In that time it has lost its set position three times while hosted on iSpyConnect. I don't know why. Maybe it isresetting itself? The product came with the latest firmware so I was happy about that. Maybe the camera is supposed to be mounted with the camera in its default position pointing where you want it? Don't know. I am not going to mount it yet. One star off.  The second issue I had was with the browser setup. I didn't want to connect the camera to a router and then figure out the IP so I decided to use a cross-over cable and static IPs. The Foscam software found the unit and allowed me to set the static IP without going onto the web page. This is a plus. However, the camera does not look like it will support IE9. I tried two PCs and nada. I had to install Firefox before I could log into the camera and set the wireless settings and change the user password. Another star off.  Even so, the picture is great, night vision is decent, and it is supported by iSpyConnect. Although the power cable is too short (aren't we expected to mount these on the ceiling?) I won't knock another star off. I would only use this for situations that might require panning and tilting (there is no zoom). For fixed positions such as doorways and entryways, I will test out the Foscam FI8909W.  As for wireless reception my maximum test distance was 20-25 feet.",07-09-2012

The camera works well once all hurdles have been overcome. It is not easy as it seems that the instructions were translated from chinese to maybe german and finally english. They are not crystal clear.<br /><br />The included software CD will install the \\""IP Camera Tool\\"". This helps you locate the camera on your local network (LAN).<br /><br />Before double-clicking on your \\""discovered\\"" camera, if you are using Internet Explorer, you will need to go into the internet tools section of IE and enable \\""download and run unsigned active X\\"". If you are using IE, the camera has to install an unsigned active X to run correctly. This is the first real pain as there are about three locations in tools that have to be enabled before IE will allow this active X to be installed. Double click the camera location in the IP camera tool, and the camera will install the active X and then you will be looking at the camera's log in page. I made a short cut in favorites to get to this page. Log in information is actually in the instructions. At this point you will be able to use the camera on your LAN.<br /><br />To make it available on the world wide web, it is necessary to enable port forwarding in the router. My router and modem are all-in-one device supplied by ISP. The camera ships with port 80 enabled. Called tech support at ISP and they walked me through setting up port forwarding in the router. Once that has been accomplished, you can access the camera via the wide area network IP of your modem. Problem is this IP changes every day so I signed up with DynDNS.org to keep track of this constantly (dynamic) changing WAN IP. DynDns actually had software built into my modem/router that enabled DynDns to track the IP and link it to a web address. Now I just go to the web address and it takes me to the log in page of the camera. This is the best tutorial I found is the DNS wizard at DynDns.org.<br /><br />The active X thing wasthe most difficult to solve as there are I think three diffent boxes that have to be enabled in the security section/custom settings of Tools/Internet Options/ in XP version of IE8. Reviewing the downloaded PDF instructions from Foscam, section 4.1.3 outlines setting up IE to accept the active X. Once that was solved, everything else was accomplished with the software that resides in the router. (port forwarding) and (dynamic DNS) I have not tried the sound yet. Picture is good. Camera IR reflects off of window at night and blinds the camera. Controls take a little practice but work fine. Presets work well to. I like having three levels of access to camera so the guest have restricted control of pan/tilt. This is a lot of technology for the money and a lot of fun when finally working.",07-09-2012

I was a bit apprehensive at first, but setup was very intuitive and quick. Nice quality all around. Linking this through a dyndns server was a bit of a pain, but I eventually figured it out. One drawback on the camera is that everytime certain parameters are re-set the camera must re-boot which takes up time and becomes a bit annoying and repetitive. An unexpected glitch occurred when I placed the camera at the front window to watch the yard and driveway. This worked beautifully during the day, but when infrared kicks on at night, the reflection of the infrared is bounced back by the glass. If you need to monitor outside, then the camera must be placed outside to avoid this. Not sure if this model is weather proof, so I may have to acquire one that is.<br /><br />Got online and bought the Foscam app, I highly suggest that you do the same. It's worth the $6+ as it offers full functionality through your tablet. Setting up the app is easier than the actual camera setup itself.<br /><br />It will be nice to travel and keep an eye on things from far away.

The FI8910W however, while billed as an improvement, does not live up to it's claims. The FI8910W adds an  Automatic IR-Cut Filter which filters out IR light from normal daytime pictures which greatly enhances the color quality over that of the FI8918W. When in almost total darkness, the IR-Cut Filter drops out, and you get the typical grey/green picture of the darkend room like all other IR cameras. The problem with the FI8910W is that the automatic IR-Cut Filter is so sensitive that with only a very small amount light in the room, either low light, or a small point source in an otherwise dark room, it IR-Cut Filter doesn't drop out. So even though the IR lights are illuminating the room, the IR-Cut Filter, filters all the IR light out, and the room appears the same as if the IR lights were not on. There is no way to either adjust the sensitivity of this feature, or to disengage it all together. This is a serious shortcoming which makes this camera inferior to it's predicessor for about twice the price. Until Foscam can fix the sensitivity issue, Avoid this camera at any price.

In addition, I found a great IOS program that runs on the Iphone and Ipad and allows me total control AND two way audio. The night vision works great too. At least up to about 10 feet or so. Only problem appears to be that moths can see the infrared and love to perform acrobatics to show off and it causes the motion detect to go off. But overall, for the price they are hard to beat (with the latest firmware). I love the ability to move in almost any direction too. It also allows FTP and Email notification of alarm conditions so I can instantly know when something is there. The only complaint I would have is that I can't set a motion detect zone or zones like my old D-Link camera could.

I also own a D-Link DCS--942L for a year now and from specification wise on both cameras, I personally find that foscam has an upper hand on picture quality, user control, and more setting options.<br /><br />Built quality wise between the Dlink-dsc 942l and foscam 8910w, I personally prefer the Dlink over the foscam. Dlink use a hard plastic body that feels very durable and solid. Foscam has a plastic matte body that feels very nice, but does not feel sturdy and solid as the Dlink. As for security surveillance camera, I feel that the foscam is very big and can not be hidden easily. This is a con for me because let's said that if there was an intruder in my house or someone who is robbing my house they can unplug the camera and it be all over because of the camera large footprint. Dlink body is about 2/3 smaller than the foscam.<br /><br /> I did not have any trouble getting the foscam 9810w camera to work. Setting up the wifi was also a breeze for me also as long you read the manual that came along with the camera. The hardest part was getting the camera to work over the Internet. It took me no more than five hours to get everything to work including getting it to work on my iPhone and my laptop over the Internet.",26-08-2012

Just followed the easy to follow instructions to first set up the camera using a wired configuration and then switched it over to wireless and it worked like a charm.  Picture quality is very good, night vision quality is excellent, pan and tilt controls work well, overall I am extremely satisfied with the camera.  I originally bought 1 camera to try first  and was so happy with it that I wound up buying 3 more and all 4 of them are working perfectly.  Setting up the remote viewing capability was a little more involved, especially for me since I had never done port forwarding on a router before and had never even heard of a DYNDNS service,, but after watching several tutorials on YouTube and doing some online research on the subject I proceeded to tackle setting up the remote viewing capability and really didn't have any problems.  Now when I'm away from home I can view my cameras from either my laptop or my Android and it works fantastic.  Gives me great peace of mind when I'm away from home to be able to check on my house and my pets whenever I'm away from home, whether I'm out to dinner with friends or away from home on vacation.  The last thing I did was set up the cameras to send an email to my AOL email when I have the motion detection alarm feature turned on and the email system works great. If the alarm is triggered the cameras will take a series of snapshots and email them to me along with the notification that the motion alarm was set off.  For the price of these cameras I think  you get one heck of a bang for your buck.  I plan on buying a couple more of these and then I'll have every room in my home covered.",25-08-2012

You'll need to create an account at a site like dyndns.org to be able to access these away from home (assuming you don't have static IPs). You create a hostname like amazonuser.homeip.net and tell each camera to point to that and to a specific port number. Each cam can point to the same hostname but must use a different port. Four cams would use, for example, port 80, 81, 82, and 83. I look at the cams with a free android app called tinyCam Monitor. With that, I can see all 4 cam views simultaneously on my cell phone screen. You double-click on a view to see that one full screen, and you can control the cam movement with touch or physical controls on your phone. I've been using 3G, and the video feed/controls sometimes crap out a little bit (black screen or unresponsive controls), but 4G works a lot better from what I've seen.

It works beautifully.  Download the $5.99 App in the Apple Store and you can view your camera remotely.  The name of the App is Foscam Pro made by Logic Consulting LLC.<br /><br />Works great with macs too.  I actually used my mac to set it up.  Pop the CD in and look for the Mac OSX folder and follow the instructions.  Basically, you drag and drop the IP Camera Tool app into your Applications Folder.  The IP Camera Tool will scan your network and look for the camera and will show you the camera's IP address.  You then use that IP Address to configure your iPhone/iPad app.  Note that when the camera is unplugged it picks up a new IP Address (have not figured out how to give it a static IP address yet).  You use that IP address to configure the App and you can monitor your baby and your babysitter whether you are in a different room in the house or out and about running errands around town.<br /><br />The camera has a built in mic so you can hear the baby remotely through your iPhone/iPad (quality is decent).  Much like the Angel Care baby monitor.  The camera also has a built-in speaker.  So you can speak to your iPhone/iPad and it can relay the sound to the camera (if you want it to).  Both features are just nice to haves and are not the greatest strength of this product.  This product's greatest strength is the ability to see your baby/babysitter regardless of where you are.<br /><br />Remote viewing works over AT&T's 3G network.<br /><br />UPDATE - 8/23/2012<br /><br />I've added two additional cameras in my system for a total of 3.  The Foscam Pro app works beautifully.  I can see all 3 cameras at the same time on my iPhone and iPad.  And if you have an Apple TV, you can AirPlay (mirror) your iPhone/iPad display on your big screen TV in the living room and see all cameras at once (if you have an iPhone 4S and the 3rd generation iPad).

It is very functional, with great features for the price. I'm actually already to planning purchase another one to use in another room.<br />Given that there are a number of IP \\""baby monitor\\"" cameras with very similar features (clones?) that are double to triple the price, I think buying this camera was a no brainer for me.<br /><br />But like most budget items, it comes with a number of trade-offs. The primary trade off that I have experienced is that the software is very basic. This means that it falls on the user to figure out how to set up their network and software to get the camera to work appropriately. As a tech savvy person, the set up wasn't a problem at all for me. For others it might be.<br />It also falls upon the consumer to purchase apps for their mobile/tablet use. There are a variety of apps compatible with this camera, but I have not (yet) found one that completely satisfies my needs. I've defaulted to using the Camviewer app. The only problem is that it doesn't  support notifications (but I haven't really found an app that does do this!)<br />For those who need more service, go for the more expensive \\""full service\\"" products.

These are shockingly good cameras for the price. I have a lot of cameras around my house and they are by far the best. We aren't paranoid and mostly use them for checking in on the pets & kids. My husband works out of town pretty often and he uses it as a fun way to stay connected to the homefront & peek in on what his family is up to. It makes him feel like he's closer to home. :)<br /><br />The picture is clear & pretty crisp, colors are true, and they seem to be built really well. Pan/Tilt is almost silent & very smooth. (Note: In the UI the P/T speed is faster when the number is lower.) When it's pointed to a bright window it adjusts the lighting so the picture isn't distorted by it. There is a bit more of a fisheye effect on these cameras than the other cams I have, but the quality and true color more than make up for it. The IR view is as good as any of my other cams and is acceptable.<br /><br />The UI is easy to use and it took me 15 minutes to have two cameras set up & viewable remotely. I am in IT support and have a pretty robust network in my home, so am used to working with webcams & remote viewing setup. If you're new to this sort of thing, plan on it taking longer and enjoy learning something new! I can't speak for the iPhone app since I use LiveCams Pro for remote viewing. I have so many different brands & types of cameras that I prefer to just use one app. I highly recommend the LiveCams app, it's loaded with features and you can adjust a lot of your camera settings directly from the app.<br /><br />*** As with every other webcam on the planet, you must know how to find open ports & forward them on your router (or know someone who does) if you want to view your cams remotely. Many cams get bad reviews due to this, and it's not the fault of the cam or manufacturer. You will not be able to view any cam of any brand remotely without taking this step! If your internet provider changes your IP address, you will have to makesome adjustments on your remote viewer to access them again. If you can view your camera locally, then there's nothing wrong with it and something just isn't set up right for remote viewing. Think of it as needing to know the address of a house and having the correct key to unlock the door, you can't get in until you have the right combination! :) ***",16-08-2012

Not only did the software not allow this, but the further attempts required me rebooting the entire computer to get the software to prompt me for IP configuration.<br /><br />This is a camera I can get in China for about $15. This company branded the item and is reselling it. No attention has been made to improve the OS or the Firmware, as the firmware is the exact same as the Chinese brand that I had in Hong Kong. To add insult, the most recent software was \\""unavailable\\"" to download off their website. You get what you pay for.<br /><br />UPDATE - I gave this camera a second chance and they have improved their game a little. Still no support and their website is horrific, but the new firmware is not bad. However, these things still like to reset themselves and return back to their \\""Home\\"" position. YOU MUST get the Blue Iris software for this camera. It is fantastic and can link up with several cameras turning this into a very affordable, security and DVR system.<br /><br />I will also say that I had focusing issues with only one cam, no matter what it was always soft even when I adjusted the ring. Night vision is not half bad but this is just a standard def video feed.",10-08-2012

I will definitely update on longevity or other issues down the road.<br /><br />Setup -- The instructions flat out did not get me there. My primary problem is that when you go to the device status page it is only showing the MAC address for the wired ethernet, which it is also calling the \\""Device ID\\"" and that is a separate issue. I was doing wireless MAC filtering and so I had entered this into my whitelist and it was not the MAC address of the wireless card, thus it never connected. I had to shut off the filter, connect to the router wirelessly, get the wireless MAC from the router, then add that into my filter list, then turn the filter list back on. The only other setup I did was to get the email up and running. That is pretty straightforward if you've ever done it before. I use gmail and it worked a treat with no problems. I also used upnp (easy mode) for the port mapping, doing it \\""the hard way\\"" is probably outside most users experience. That took me maybe 30 minutes of futzing around to get done. Not horrible but I've done better. I also have extensive networking experience, I'm a programmer, and in general a super geek so your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Features -- Love it. I'm coming from using an old logitech quickcam pro 4000 which is still working but I really needed the new features for the area I'm trying to cover. The picture on full resolution is nice and clear, I could easily make a facial ID from it. The ability of the cam to go through a power outage and recover while my computer remains down is a BIG plus. That removes the middleman and a point of failure. I went ahead and splurged and bought the iPhone app FoscamPro almost immediately. It's the more expensive one of the selection but its without a doubt better. It lets me stand and monitor my house with video and sound and the controls are nice on it. Plus I can make a recording and take pictures straight to my phoneso no one can just steal the camera and other stuff and leave no evidence (the motion detection takes care of this immediately but I might want to just get in there and manually control the camera).<br /><br />Conclusion -- I had expected some mega battle due to all the bad stuff out there. I'm aware they are padding the positive reviews, either directly or by proxy. If they really are getting all those customers to come in and add good reviews then one thing is certain; they must be providing quality service after purchase. The manual needs to be rewritten, the wireless MAC needs to display on the status page, all the MAC addresses should be labeled as such instead of \\""Device ID\\"". Other than that, I have no problem as of day 1 of usage.",08-08-2012

My impressions thus far:<br /><br />  - The picture is decent quality, though not excellent.<br /><br />  - I got the IR ON/OFF to work by hacking the app.  The javascript written for the UI is not cross-browser compliant.<br /><br />  - The software that installs on PC or Mac could really use a decent UI.  What is offered is pretty rough.<br /><br />  - The JPEG files generated by the camera do NOT play well with the PHP GD library.  I'm unable to generate thumbnail images on the fly because GD complains that the image is not a valid JPEG.<br /><br />  -  There really ought to be an API that would allow you to write your own applications for the camera.  There's already an unexposed API to some degree, but an exposed and published on would be cool.<br /><br />  - Like many other reviewers here, I find the casing light.  I have this camera outside, although it's under the roof of one of my outbuildings.  We'll see how it holds up.<br /><br />  - Alerts should allow for more granular control.<br /><br />  - Wireless works, but the wireless scan didn't pick up the LAN.  Further, wireless should support more security protocols.<br /><br />  - The default alert sensitivity of '10' will almost never be suitable.

After being broken in twice, I decided to purchase this relatively inexpensive security camera to monitor my home while I was on a trip.  At first, I was worried about the wireless setup, since I do not have any experience in setting up server or network.  However, the setup turned out to be surprisingly easy, well, at least within my home network.  However, just like a lot of the reviewers, I got stuck on the remote access setup.  After a lot of trouble shooting, I realized that it is because I didn't setup the port forward correctly.  In my house, I have a Linksys wireless router connected to a wireless cable modem, which was provided by my internet service provider.  I placed these two routers in separate rooms, so that I can have strong signals everywhere in my house.  The problem is that I used the Linksys router to configure port forwarding, instead of my primary wireless cable modem, so that every time I try to access my IP camera (which is essentially a server) using my DYNDNS address, I was being routed to the wrong location.  To solve this problem, I reboot the camera by having it connected to the wireless cable modem, and use the wireless cable modem to setup the port forwarding.  Problem solved!!  I also heard about you can turn your wireless cable modem on \\""bridge mode\\"", which is essentially degrade your wireless cable modem to just a modem without the wireless function, and then set up the port forwarding on your wireless router (e.g. Linksys).  Either way would work!  The port forward is really not that hard to set up, and the little booklet that comes with the camera did a decent job on illustrating each step.  Once I realized where I did wrong, it took me only 10 minutes to complete the remote access setup.  To test whether you have the camera correctly setup, simply turn off the wireless function on your 3G or 4G device (e.g. iphone, ipad, ...) and use the cellular data to connect to the camera by entering your dyndns address in a web browser.  If you can see the live stream video, then you are all set.<br /><br />Here are some random notes:<br /><br />1. AwkwardHamster on YouTube did a nice step-by-step illustration on foscam setup for both within and outside of home network.<br /><br />2. If you are an iPad user, there are some great foscam apps for download.  If you simply use a web browser, you won't be able to use the joystick function to point the camera to a specific location.<br /><br />3. some old wireless cable modems (e.g. Zhone, model: 6218-I2-200 0CL) do not have port forward function, in this case, you need to call your Internet service provider and request a replacement (should be free of charge, only shipping cost).<br /><br />4. Some wireless cable modem refer to the port forwarding function as \\""virtual server\\"", you should be able to find it under NAT or Gaming.<br /><br />5. Some reviews complaint that the DYNDNS Host service is not free of charge, which is not true.  You need to sign up for their 14-day free trial, and give them your credit card number.  After you setup the hostname, just cancel the subscription within the trial period, and you still get to keep one hostname free of charge.  Your hostname should connect to the external IP address of your home network, which is the IP you found using the whatismyip webside (do not use any proxy).<br /><br />6. Don't forget to change the default username (\\""admin\\"") and password (no password), otherwise, anybody who knows your dyndns address can access to your camera.<br /><br />__________________________________________________________________<br />A summary of step-by-step remote access setup using dynamic IP:<br /><br />1. Get an account on DYNDNS site and get a free hostname (yes, you need to sign up for the trial and give them your credit card, but you can cancel the subscription within the trial period and still get to keep one hostname).  Your service type should be \\""host with IPaddress\\"".  DynDNS site will automatically detect your external IP.  If not, just go to whatismyip site and get your external ip address from them.<br /><br />2. Log in to your router: in most cases, type 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 (if you have more than two wireless routers, use the one from your internet service provider).  You can find the default username and password from the router manual or you can google it on the internet.  The default is often either \\""admin\\"" or \\""user\\"" for both username and password.<br /><br />3. Log in to your camera.  You can do this by using the IP camera tool in the CD or type in the IP that your router assign to your camera in a web browser. It usually begins with 192.168.1.X<br /><br />3. On the menu, go to \\""Device Management\\"", then \\""Basic Network Setting\\"".  Make sure you have the \\""Obtain IP from DHCP server\\"" and \\""Network Lamp\\"" checked.  As for the port, I just use the default \\""80\\"", but I heard some routers save that port for other stuff, so you might want to change it to 8080 or other numbers.  The port number you set up here will determine the specific port that your camera will use and you will need that information when you set up port forwarding.<br /><br />4. On the camera menu, go to DDNS service settings, fill out your DYNDNS account information and your hostname, then \\""submit\\"", and wait for the 30s reboot patiently.  Go to your camera menu again, and \\""Device Status\\"", if it shows \\""DynDns Succeed\\"", then you are good to continue.  Note that it might take some time (5 minutes) for your DynDns account to take effect.<br /><br />5. Go to your wireless router menu again (192.168.1.1), then go to port forwarding (or virtual server).  Both the external and internal ports should match to the port number you set up in the previous step (e.g. 80).  For the protocol, choose \\""both\\"" if you are given an option between TCP or UDP.  If not, just choose TCP.<br /><br />6. To test out the remote access, you must use a computer outside of your home network or use your 3G/4G device with cellular data (remember to shut off the wireless!!) or use your computer with a proxy to mask your external router IP.  Open up a web browser and key in your DYNDNS address followed by a colon [ : ] and your port number (e.g. 80).<br /><br />7. If you are within the home network, you must use the camera IP and correct port (e.g. 192.168.1.4:80) to access your camera.<br /><br />Hope this helps!!address\\"".

Wished I would have called them sooner and saved tons of time.  I had to call them a second time when I added a Sprint AirRave to my network.  For some reason, this device blocked my camera, again, from being viewed remotely.  I called Foscam again, spoke to an employee named Sean, and he, again, fixed the problem in only a few minutes.  Although the device is had to set up if you don't have networking knowledge, I am very impressed at the support by Foscam.  Good product, Good Support.  I recommend it.",01-08-2012

Look for that product and you will see that I did own this product because I posted the same review for it. I just know that more people buy the single camera and I wanted them to find my review. I hope this helps with your decision making!<br /><br />For the price of these cameras, they work pretty well. I didn't have any issues setting them up but I am an IT professional (bachelor's degree in CIT) and I am very familiar with networking. I thought the included instructions were good enough to allow most people to set these up without assistance but if you have trouble, there are many how-to articles that can be easily found online. The cameras have a very solid construction. I bought two of these in a set with the larger 9dB antennas included. I ended up not using the larger antennas - well because they are far larger than I expected them to be (probably 8-9 inches long). I have a ~1,300 square foot home and didn't have any issues with signal when using the standard antennas that are about 1/3 the size of the larger ones. The two way audio on the cameras was only OK. It seemed to be better for listening than talking through the camera - which was fine for me because one of the cameras was intended use was just for a baby monitor. The audio didn't work so well though when the IR was on. The IR lights must generate a signal interference that is picked up by the mic on the camera because when the IR was on, there was a constant noise when listening through the camera. The image quality over all was excellent in both day and night modes. The only issue I had was the IR is activated automatically by a photo sensor that detects the amount of ambient light present in the room. You can manually (through software)turn this off when it comes on automatically but I was not able to turn it on if the photo sensor detected too much light in the room and hadn't turned it on for you. This bothered me because at the in between level of the photo sensor turning on the IR mode for low light operation versus daylight operation, I was sure that I could have gotten a better image if I could have manually turned it on sooner. The biggest problem for me with these cameras was the FPS. This camera uses MJPEG for video compression. This method of compression is not efficient at all and creates very large file sizes. In order to view the feed remotely, this large file size has to be transmitted. I am not for sure if the large file sizes are truly the cause of the very low FPS I got on both cameras or if it was some other limitation but I am pretty certain that I wasn't getting the expected 15 FPS (VGA - 640x480 resolution) or the 30 FPS (QVGA - 320x240 resolution). I didn't have a way to measure my actual FPS but my video feeds were very jerky and more like time elapsed still images (which is actually what MJPEG is). I would guess that I was getting at best 1/2 the FPS that was advertised. I suspect that the transmittal of the large video size was also affecting the sound quality because so much bandwidth was consumed by the video that little was left for audio. These cameras also only work on up to wireless G networks that have a max 54Mpbs throughput. With all this said, even though I have rated these with 4 stars, I am returning them. I am replacing them with the Foscam FI8608W IP cams. These are the newer model in this lineup. They support H.264 video compression, which can reduce video file size by up to 80% over MJPEG. The FI8608W model also has wireless N support (600Mbps), a memory card slot that supports up to 32GB cards for recording, and it has a faster processor. I expect all of this to provide me with a significant improvement in both video, audio, and recording. The FI8608W models are ~$45 more though but I think that is justifiable with the enhancements. I forgot to mention, something that I wondered about the FI8910W model when I was thinking about ordering them was about the software for remote viewing. It is very functional and you can create three types of log on accounts for people that you want to allow to view/operate the cameras. You can have administrators, operators, and viewers. Admins can do anything. Operators can view the cameras and use the PTZ functions to adjust where the camera points. Viewers can just log in and see what the camera is currently pointing at. The software for the FI8910W does easily integrate with up to 9 cameras. The app IP Cam Viewer ($3.99 on the Apple App Store) from Robert Chou which is mentioned by several other reviewers really does work well for accessing the cameras.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />As I originally stated, I replaced these cameras with the FI8608W camers. I purchased them off from Amazon.com as well - so you can find my review of that camera online as well. Please read about my experience with the 8608 cameras before making your decision. The hardware for the 8608 is improved but the software was broken with the new firmware and web GUI interface. Depending on what you value as important, the 8910 model may be the better option for you.",26-07-2012

I have average understanding of routers and firewalls and the such, but by reading the advice written here from other Amazon customers, I was able to get my camera up and running on our wireless network, and remotely accessible via my iPhone and computer, within an hour.  This camera is not a \\""plug and play\\"" and requires a bit of tweaking, but it is relatively straight forward and I found more than plenty of information among the reviews here and on a Google search to help me.  If you know how to access your router on your home network, you should be able to set this camera up.<br /><br />The camera works great.  The screen resolution is pretty good.  We use this as a video monitor to see what our toddler is doing in his room after we put him down for the night.  The infrared on this camera is so good that it pretty much lights up his room, and the resolution is sufficient enough that we can see him breathing in near total darkness (camera is about 10 feet away from the bed in a 15x13 foot room.)  The ability to pan and tilt remotely is great. We're so happy with it that we're buying 2 more to use in the living room and as a security camera for the front door.<br /><br />It's odd that some of the commenters will give this camera a low rating just because they couldn't figure out how to set it up.

I am the owner of a Samsung security DVR system with 8 cameras and I have an HD webcam set up in the house to watch our puppy. Both of these systems have remote admin and viewing set up so I have lived the torture of seting up port fowarding, Wifi and firewall changes, powerline network adaptors and a slew of other technical hurdles the marketing people don't mention when you look at these things.  The FOSCAM wasn't the largest learning curve but it did provide a few WTH? moments.<br /><br />The FOSCAM .US website is pretty good with tutorials and the forums make up for some of the particulars of unique routers that the tutorials leave out.  I have AT&T Uverse and it presents its own odd requirements when setting up port forwarding but I was able to find others that had already solved or at least asked the same questions.  You will need an open ethernet port to set this baby up, and you might be forced to change the Wifi security settings in order to get it to work wirelessly.  An above average understanding of networking will help (a lot) especially if you don't want to open up your wireless network completely.  One thing to mention here - the FOSCAM has a MAC address for its wired connection and another one for its wireless connection.  This alone caused me about an hour of head scratching before I found that nugget of information in the forums.<br /><br />The software the unit comes with does an adequate job and includes some advanced features for security such as motion detection, image capture, notification/alerts and FTP upload of stills.  If you want to see and manipulate the camera via your smart phone there are dozens of apps for both the iPhone and Android systems, even a couple free ones.  I use IPCam Viewer and have all my systems viewable from one app.  The camera has a pretty good speaker and microphone for two way communication but Ive found when using cell data the transmissions are garbled.  If Im within Wifi coverage you can make out about 75% of what is said - maybe 1 word out of 50 though with 3G cell data.<br /><br />Helpful hint for motion alerts: you can normally use an email address to text your phone, I have AT&T and an iPhone so I would enter my 10 digit phone number followed by @ txt.att.net and when the system detects movement I will get a text message (not email) telling me so.<br /><br />The night characteristics of this camera are OUTSTANDING.  I'll upload a couple pictures with and without the IR illuminator to demonstrate.<br /><br />One big negative; the camera appears to freeze every so often.  Ive read from many people that it's a wifi issue with the camera itself.  It's a temporary thing, lasting maybe 3-5 seconds then the live picture comes back.  Ive begun to experiment with placement and changing wifi channels but so far nothing appears to fix it.  I might try an Apple Airport Express setup up and attach the FOSCAM to the Express via Cat5 just to see if the radio in the FOSCAM is the culprit.  If so the system might go back...  I don't want to use a $100 Apple device to fix a $95 wireless camera.<br /><br />I do recommend this camera.  Having purchased several other cams this is the only one that has so many desired features and a support community to help figure out your unique setup.  For under a $100 this thing is a good deal and gets the job done, just dont think you are getting a \\""plug and play\\"" device when purchasing it.m within Wifi coverage you can make out about 75% of what is said - maybe 1 word out of 50 though with 3G cell data.<br /><br />Helpful hint for motion alerts: you can normally use an email address to text your phone, I have AT&T and an iPhone so I would enter my 10 digit phone number followed by @ txt.att.net and when the system detects movement I will get a text message (not email) telling me so.<br /><br />The night characteristics of this camera are OUTSTANDING.

I started out by just buying this Foscam & one Dlink Camera.  I actually thought I was going to like the Dlink much more at first when I set them up given the ease at which the Dlink camera started up & synced.  Although the Foscam did require a bit more knowledge on networking (of which I might add.. i have none!) I did manage to figure it out after a successful tech-support call.<br /><br /> If you want to access these cameras ( I actually ended up returning the Dlink and buying a second Foscam) outside of your network, you must learn how to forward an IP address. It really isn't as scary as it sounds for those of you who haven't done it before.  Don't shy away from this camera if you don't have a clue how to set up a forwarding of an IP address.  There are plenty of sites online to walk you through it, as well as the tech-support for Foscam does a direct link to your computer and can set it up for you remotely.<br /><br />The reasons I chose this camera over the others are<br /><br /> #1, the remote movement.  I don't have to have it pointed in only one small location all the time. I can move it at any time I wish remotely, from anywhere I am.<br /><br />#2, it had a wider angle lens than the Dlink cameras which allows me to see more at one time<br /><br />#3, it has a much higher quality image (even when set at a lower resolution) than the other cameras.  Even at a lower resolution, the image it's self is clearer, and has MUCH better nighttime vision than some others i've tried.<br /><br />#4, it works nicely with 3rd party software for recording and uploading, no glitches, just works... \\""it plays nice with others\\""<br /><br />in conclusion.. i give it a 4 instead of a 5, just do to the complication of getting it set up.. but.. in the process i've learned how to do something that turns out wasn't hard at all!.. just something I hadn't learned how to do for fear that it would actually be hard.. and it wasn't .. just time consuming right at first... now all is wonderful and I couldn't be happier with my choice.  I've had them outside (simi-covered) for 6 months now & still working great!",23-07-2012

You see Vonage VDV22-VD sits between your cable modem and my netgear router and blocks everything.  Here's the kicker, it's IP is 192.168.15.1 and my router's IP range is 192.168.1.2 - 192.168.1.254.1.  VDV22-VD only allows you to port forward in the 192.168.15.x range (I tried DMZ to the foscam IP in my router and that didn't work).  So here's what I did, I went to vonage admin page at 192.168.15.1 , user & pass are both 'router' , basic settings > local network setup in the vonage router and change the IP to from 192.168.15.1 to 192.168.1.2 (change the range from 3-254).  Now turn off everything and re-wire like this:<br /><br />Cable modem > Regular router > VDV22-VD, PC.  Fire everything up and it should work given the range in your router is set from .2-.254<br /><br />BTW the best app on android to manage foscam remotely is TinyCam IMO, haven't really looked at ios apps just yet.",22-07-2012

It took me 20 minutes to get it setup and connected to the wireless.  There are alot of negative reviews, most are because people do not know how to open up their household router/firewall to gain external access.  These complaints should not be directed toward this product as it is their firewall that is doing what it's supposed to do.  This is like not knowing how to drive and blaming a car manufacturer.  The instructions do include how to configure port forwarding in your firewall, however, there are hundreds of different router/firewall devices out there.  A 10 page &quot;quick install&quot; manual cannot possibly cover every scenario.  If you're looking on gaining access to your camera from the internet, learn how to do it or get some assistance on how to do it.",19-07-2012

Installation is a bit of work, but do able.","This Wireless camera works great and allows us to monitor our Condo at the Beach. Pictures are sharp enough at 640x480 and has full motion Video with sound. The basic Software in the Camera provides good functionality with remote access from any web Browser.  The Camera's internal Setup is menu driven and allows you to set the network connections, move the camera, turn on Auto-motion Detection, shoot 5 pictures and then upload them to your email automatically.<br /><br />I also purchased \\""Foscam Pro\\"" for my iPhone for immediate accesswith full functionality. It looks great on my iPad with the larger screen.  We use the two-way audio to hear and announce something like: \\""Hello - This is the Security Office. Please identify yourself.\\""  We get peace of mind with no monthly fees from a security company.<br /><br />The installation procedure is a bit complex as noted in other reviews. Fortunately the setup can be mastered by following the online guides. Three of them and each is pretty good. One Lesson for each of the major steps. First, you plug the Camera into your Network to run Setup.  Second, you add your wireless IP Address so you can unplug your network cable. Third, you setup the advanced features for email alerts, network settings, port forwarding, which are optional features.  Each of the 3 Segments has instructions on their US website.  They even did one better by posting separate Network install procedures for 10 of the top Routers making it easy for most computer novices to complete.  Plus, their Phone Support guys are great.  My call back time was about 30 minutes later.  They can easily help with any remote setup problems over the phone on their 1-800 number.<br /><br />Watch a good video introduction on YouTube from the AckwardHampster.<br />Just search for: \\""Foscam 8910 Setup\\"" or \\""AckwardHampster\\""<br /><br />Cheers and good luck mate.

US,16130510,RSA3UQIC17FXV,Foscam FI8910W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with IR-Cut Filter for True Color Images - 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67° Viewing Angle) NEWEST MODEL,Camera,4,6,6,N,N,"Good, but the Foscam FI8608W is better","The condensed version:<br />The Foscom FI8910W is a great value considering its features and price point. If features pan, tilt, day/night, all the features you have read about elsewhere. But there is a new kid on the block. It has smoother playback and much smaller file sizes. It's called the Foscam FI8608W. Identical to the FI8910W, but adds H.264 compression and a SD card slot.<br /><br />Is it worth it?<br /><br />Longer version:<br /><br />First off, a little background. I have needed to replace the office security system for a while. It's an 8 camera analog piece of junk and I've been looking for a good IP solution to pop up. A few weeks ago I came across the FI8910W on amazon which gets awesome reviews. After a few days of research I ordered three cameras to test, the Foscam FI8608W, Foscam FI8910W and eSKY 5900. After testing each one, I am going to pick a favorite, buy 7 more and probably return the other two.<br /><br />Lets do a quick run down on the cameras.<br />- Foscam FI8910W $85, very popular, Pan & Tilt, Day/night, WiFi, two way audio ip camera<br />- Foscam FI8608W $140, newest, same as FI8910W but adds H.264 compression and SD slot<br />- eSKY 5900 $95 with same hardware specs as FI8608W! But not as popular, not as much info floating around the interwebs either.<br /><br />I'm using Blue Iris management software so the first thing I needed to do was add the cameras to the system. I used the camera detection software provided with each camera to get the IP addresses, then added them to Blue Iris and started comparing the differences.<br /><br />I started with the eSKY 5900 first. I wanted this one to work because it had all the features of the FI8608W for $45 less. But I learned quickly that the pan and tilt are not supported in Blue Iris so I had to ditch it early on. It looks to be a good camera, I used the built in webserver and free management software for about 20 minutes, it was perfectly acceptable. The video was just as good as the foscams, pan and tilt worked fine in the web admin. I also liked that the microphone was under the camera lens so it points in the same direction of the camera (the foscam's don't). Although I didn't test the audio to compare if it made a difference or not.<br /><br />Next I tested the FI8910W side by side with the FI8608W. Fortunately both Foscam are fully supported by Blue Iris. Mainly, I wanted to compare file sizes and video quality because the main benefit of the FI8608W is H.264 compression. What is H.264 you say? Well I'm glad you asked!<br /><br />It's a compression algorithm, a fancy way of saying squeezing videos to take up less space. If you're a late 90's or early naughty's kid, you may remember when MP3's became popular. MP3 is a compression algorithm too, its just for audio files. Back then, a store bought album on CD-ROM would fit 15 to 17 songs max, but CD-ROM with MP3s can fit hundreds of songs. H.264 is MP3 for video. Smaller video files means more bang for buck out of your hard drive space. It also means less network traffic and smaller files for your server to render.<br /><br />Back to the comparison. Both cameras are setup in an identical fashion. Same frame rate (10fps), sensitivity, audio etc. I made several clips of my dog, me waving my arms, me walking in front of the cameras etc and compared the output files. And the results were pretty clear, the H.264 makes a substantial difference. The video is a lot smoother, and there is less delay. In fact, I dropped the FI8608W down to 5 frames per second and it looked better than the FI8910W at 10 frames per second. And file sizes, oh yeah, the file sizes are much smaller. With both cameras at 10 fps i would guess an average of 50% file size reduction. Drop the FI8608W down to 5fps, compare it to the FI8910W at 10 fps, (the FI8608W still visually looks better) and you'll get a 70% reduction in file size on average. So if you have enough storage for 2 weeks with FI8910W's, with FI8608W you'll get 6 weeks!<br /><br />I also compared the web admin software and iPhone compatibilities. The FI8608W pulls ahead here too. Most notably, the FI8608W supports pan and tilt on the iphone where the FI8910W does not. Also, you can set the frame rate for the FI8608W in the web admin but not in the FI8910W. This allows you to control it much better in external management applications like Blue Iris. One thing I didn't like about the FI8608W, was I couldn't disable \\""go to center on boot\\"" like the FI8910W allows. So basically if the camera reboots, I have to pan and tilt it back where I want. Not a huge deal but I think it may be fixed in a later firmware rev.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />So out of the three cameras I tested over the last few days the FI8608W is the most expensive at $140, but for my needs it is well worth the extra $55. I wanted the eSKY 5900 to work but it was not fully compatible with my management software, if pan and tilt are supported in the future in Blue Iris I may check it out again. The FI8910W is perfectly acceptable for a baby cam, single cam security system or as part of a multi cam security system in an area with low activity. I need 8 cameras monitoring a busy office with as long an archive as possible, so H.264 has a big impact. Network bandwidth consumption and smooth playback are also important. So for 7 of the 8 cameras I am willing to spend the extra $55 to upgrade to the FI8608W's. However, I am going to keep the FI8910W for a data closet cam that will get very little activity. In this case the H.264 is not worth it.<br /><br />I'm going to buy one of the FI8608W's directly off Foscam's website so I can get support, but the other 5 will be from amazon because they are $20 cheaper. That way I can get support on the \\""go to center on boot\\"" and ask general firmware questions etc. Also, I am going to buy AIR802 PASSPOE-03's power over Ethernet splitters so I don't have to deal with external power supplies. They are only $6 and well worth it if youlack a near by power outlet or don't want someone to be able to unplug your camera.<br /><br />Anyhow I hope all this rambling helps someone. I enjoy tinkering around with technology and wanted to share what I learned!",19-07-2012

Got one for work and one for home and both needed assistance and both were satisfied within 30 minutes of the call!  I plan on buying 4 more. Use it on my ipad/iphone/ipod and are very good.  Had difficulty port forwarding on the first one and for some reason had more difficulty accessing my 2wire and SEAN at Foscam tech support was great! So far they are 2 for 2 in helping me get it up and running! Love it!  Update: June 11,2015 Have 11 foscams for 3 different locations and these are working great for what I need. Other than audio not being fluid in sound (goes out like 1 second every 4 seconds) it's great. Do have to say that they are not made well for being in direct sunlight.  I have one on the inside window looking out into front yard and the surface of the camera is tacky/sticky from the heat I guess but works fine. Plan on getting a couple more.  Update April 7, 2016 Have a total of 12 foscams for 3 different locations and these still are working great!! Audio has been a little better after getting faster internet but still not as fluid but good enough.  I am very pleased with them so.  Wished they had some that had a wider angle though.  Other than that I would highly recommend this camera, especially now that it's cheaper.  I don't plan on getting any newer models but plan on getting another one of these.  &#34;Don't fix what ain't broken.&#34;",13-07-2012

I eventually got most of the feature set to work but the few features that are not working properly are deal killers for me.  If you want to use this inside one network (camera and viewing application) it works fine cabled.  It turns out there are a few different versions of this camera, all with the same part number (FI8910W), and mine happens to be one of the versions that has known problems with IR-CUT and wireless operations.  The user interfaces (both application and via web browser) are \\""good enough\\"" but not definitely not where they could be.<br /><br />If you are buying this camera to function as a baby monitor, it will work fine.  Anything more than that though (e.g. remote monitoring through internet using Android phone, motion detection recording and alerts, etc.), and it's clunky at best in my opinion.<br /><br />If you're wondering, I spent many hours on the Foscam forum and searching internet for solutions to the hurdles I hit during setup.  Bottom line, I'm returning this camera.  If you're not very comfortable with things like port forwarding, DDNS, setting up static IP addresses, and firmware updates, this camera's setup is not for you.

I emailed the technical team several times with the issue. I found that respond from the technical team was very slow, Foscam took on average 2 weeks respond back each time I emailed them. Foscam do NOT have a UK technical support, and therefore I had to call the US for any support (rather expensive), when I did call the US I kept getting the message 'you are in the queue', and kept me hanging on for ages. Today (11/07/2012) I got through to the Technical team in the US via telephone and spoke to Ralph Mendez, the technical support agent, who was very good and has now got my camera working via wireless. So in summary, for technical support when I got through to Foscam the service is very good, however via email it is very poor.<br /><br />In terms of the camera, one of the downfall I see is that the viewing angle is very narrow and secondly, on a sunny day the images come out white, because of the infra red.",11-07-2012

The directions were easy to follow and set up an account on No-IP.com (recommend highly) but still no luck. No problem though. Called technical support, got hooked up with Jees and in under 15 minutes he had the camera up and running remotely. It seems that we needed to do port forwarding not only at the router (Netgear) but also on the Comcast modem/router as well. Once we did this, bingo - remote viewing was possible.

I had purchased a competing D-Link 942-L, which had a horrid delay as well as no pan/tilt features.  Overall, this product is far superior, easier to install (with a modicum of knowledge of IP) and works well.  The one issue I had was getting the camera to connect from outside this intranet.  Ralph Mendez from cust support was excellent in his diagnostics and repaired this problem by simply changing the port from 8080 to 8090.  I would certainly recommend this for moderately tech savy consumers who want more flexibility at a cheaper price than off-the-shelf baby monitors.  I cannot comment on long-term use, as this is still the second day of ownership.  BTW, I have about a 1-2 second delay with audio, with a relatively low frame rate.  Performance without audio is markedly silky and smooth.",10-07-2012

Great Value~!!!!,"Got this camera a couple days ago and it's had near flawless performance. I bought it to monitor my vehicle (As I caught some guys about to break in a few weeks ago), but the camera doesn't work too well through a window at night (The Infrared lights cause too much glare and don't reach far enough to be effective). One Idea I came up with is to buy an outdoor \\""IR Illuminator\\"" (Many models are sold her on amazon), and to setup the Illuminator to point to my vehicle, and for my camera to have it's IR lights off... this way I imagine I would be able to avoid glare and still have plenty of illumination. I'll edit my review if I decide to go this route to let everyone know my results.<br /><br />For now my camera monitors a bedroom, and works very well at doing so.<br /><br />The Setup...<br /><br />The camera was available right after I plugged in the Ethernet cable, and the software was easy to install and as far as I can tell it simply locates the IP address of the camera - Not really needed for those who are familiar with their Router GUI and are able to identify the IP address of all attached devices.<br /><br />The first thing I did after I plugged in the Ethernet cable was to login and browse through the features - As I'm sure nearly everyone does the first time they connect. I had some issues with Internet Explorer login mode (As I should have expected :-p ), IE wouldn't let me install the plugin no matter how I adjusted the Internet settings. I should note that I tried the Chrome login mode first, but as I later found out this failed because my pop-up blocker was blocking the login.<br /><br />Once I worked that issue out I was able to browse the various camera settings and features. Wifi connected instantly without a hitch.<br /><br />Like other have said, getting the camera on the internet can be a bit tricky. People who are not patient or who are technically incompetent should not buy this camera expecting everything to work right out of the box. It's a little complicated to get the camera online because there are many different ways that internet is transmitted, there are many different ISP methods, many different router types, etc.<br /><br />I have comcast which conveniently utilizes static IP's (IP's that don't change), so I didn't need to mess with DynDNS settings. The camera's default HTTP port 80 worked for me as well since comcast allows this. Basically all I had to do was to enable uPnP on my camera and router... which automatically sends any external port 80 requests to the internal IP address of my router where the camera is connected to(through port 80... which is the HTTP port anyways), so I don't have to specify my port number when I try to access my camera via internet (ex: 89.231.34.223:8090). To put it simply... you just need to either port forward all external port 80 requests (or whatever port you set your camera to under \\""Basic Network Settings\\"" > \\""Http Port\\"")to your internal ip address where your camera sits (ex: 192.168.1.7). I should also add that if you do happen to modify your camera's Http port then you can no longer access the camera through LAN, and you would then need to specify the appropriate port number (ex: if you set your camera's port to 8090 then your LAN ip address would need to be something like 192.168.1.7:8090).<br /><br />One final thing on getting your camera setup for web use... you should also set your camera's IP address to be static (non-changing) by creating a rule under your router's DHCP settings. This will prevent you from not being able to access your camera after it's IP lease has expired.<br /><br />The good news is that once it's setup right you'll never need to change a thing (unless of course your setup changes).<br /><br />I love the features of this camera! You really get a great deal!!!<br />For example, you can provide temporary access to someone by creating a temporary login in the camera's settings. The alarm feature is worth the price of the camera alone!!!You receive an email within seconds of someone entering the view of the camera! You can also specify 4 email addresses to send the motion alarm alerts and snapshots to, and I configured mine to send me a text message every time the alarm goes off! (Most text message accounts can be accessed via email... you can find out your text email address by sending yourself an email through your text messenger). So... I get the motion snapshots sent instantly to my phone and I know right away if I need to respond to the situation.<br /><br />The infrared turns on automatically so you never have to worry about it. There are also other features which may come in handy... such as FTP uploads, and integration with the MSN messenger.<br /><br />The camera works quite well with 3rd party programs, various iphone/ipad, and android/tablet ip applications (ip cam viewer is what I've tried).<br /><br />The camera his highly accurate! It updates times through online time servers. The alarm can by set by the hour, and it starts working the second it's set to be enabled.<br /><br />The brand and quality are very good, but I wish they would offer some more premium models in the $150 - $250 range. Therefore...<br /><br />Features I wish FOSCAM would incorporate in another camera (and that I would be willing to pay more for):<br />-Optical Zoom! at least 10x would be sweeeeet! Plus at least the option of digital zoom in the stock software.<br />-High resolution (true 720P!)<br />-Wireless N (current models only offer wireless G)<br />-The ability to record video to a computer or server... not just snapshots<br />...and possibly a Pan/Tilt/Zoom/wifi model that is made for outdoor use.",08-07-2012

The user interface is somewhere between pathetic and laughable - a mishmash of software bits that you have to construct like a jigsaw puzzle.  It's long, painful and aggravating.<br /><br />2) The motion detection only works if you have the iPhone app OPEN.  Otherwise, not so much.<br /><br />3) When motion detection is on (even if the app isn't open) it sucks your phone battery down like a drunk at happy hour.<br /><br />4) And the kicker is that it ISN'T WIRELESS.

Log file in camera has the wrong date.,"Somewhat easy to set up. Some of the software you have to get on your own. The software for the camera itself is very small and shady in my opinion. You log in to it with a browser. The infra red has settings change and a relay clicks loud. There are bright LED's on the back. One (network traffic - green) you can shut off. The other is red. There is a red glow with the infra red LEDs as well. Kind of gives it away. Also it has a light sensor and switches back and forth with infra red on and off. It is like setting up a router in a way. Has many features but I haven't got them to work quite yet but want to. FTP, EMAIL, ... How you get it through a firewall is another issue. Has motion detection which is pretty neat. It is frame by frame NOT PIR. I haven't got that to work on the camera itself but with other software I found. There is an alert feature but doesn't seem to work for me. I've checked it and doesn't seem to do what I want. Upload file on motion or something but maybe you have to set it up with FTP or something. The date and time of the log file in the camera doesn't seem to work as well. When checking your location it seems to always jump away from it as well (EAS). I guess you can sync it with some time online web sites for time. Even if the time is set the log file still reports some other date.<br /><br />Can't get it to work with IE. It could be router, firewall, AV, or other software needed. Have to isolate it or turn all the other stuff off and try to get it to work.<br /><br />Thought you could use it to see from inside to outside but that doesn't seem to work too well. It is more for indoor use I think. The night vision in pitch black works great. Again the LED's are very noticeable as well as a switching noise if going from day light to night. When it first initializes it takes forever to rotate. It does this rotation sequence every time you reboot/change a setting. Also has a count down to wait for a reboot. Like come on now. The swing motor speed is adjustable. While turning, it is very quiet. Reminds me of those neat telescopes. The exterior is rubber like and flat black almost looking like a stealth something. The shinny LED's, clicking noise, red glow of infra red gives it away as well as the bright LED's on the back. The native resolution is something like 640x.. So you get a small image window. If you ever tried positioning a camera though that can be a tough job to get it just right. Has a few presets as well. Those are handy but only has 8 of them. goto preset 1 or something and boom it jumps there. There is a setup manual and then a user manual on a disk. It would have been nice if printed but doesn't come like that. The setup documentation is a quick lesson to get it going.",04-07-2012

The addition of the IR Cut Filter over the earlier Foscam models has definitely improved daytime color reproduction. Pan/tilt works well, though I do frequently find myself wishing for a zoom. At this price point, true zoom simply doesn't exist.<br /><br />The only real downside to the FI8910W and the other Foscam cameras I have used is that the wireless connection is unreliable. If you use the camera's wireless adapter to connect to the camera, it will drop randomly (as much as twice a day) and require a power cycle to reconnect. Using a wireless bridge like the WNCE2001 or just a regular wired connection yields much better reliability. Newer model FI8910Ws that have a new Wireless N module are working their way into the supply chain. I am waiting a bit for these to be more common before ordering additional cameras in hopes that the new module is more reliable as well.",27-06-2012

Early on it kept falling off the network and I had to re-boot it regularly, so I bought an antenna extender and that helped a lot. It only stopped responding occasionally for a few months. But little by little, almost too gradual to notice, it fell off the network and I made the trek downstairs to re-boot it.<br /><br />I was getting so frustrated that I considered buying a remote power device that could be controlled wirelessly, but after re-booting, it would work fine for a couple of days and I'd think it was all OK. Today, however, it falls off the net at least every few days and up to several times a day. So I've had to order a different brand.<br /><br />This problem has been known for years now; you can see the reports on Foscam's forum pages and on Amazon's reviews. When the camera is on the network, it works well and does everything I want. But I've lost hours of motion captures because the camera falls off the network in the middle of the night, or when I'm not home, etc. It's just not reliable enough for security or monitoring something you consider important.<br /><br />Leaving other network devices like tablets or smartphones near the camera indicate that the WiFi signal is strong, and those devices stay connected. More to the point, if the camera loses the network temporarily, it should re-connect when it can on its own and not require a reboot. Smartphones, tablets,  and most modern devices all do that.<br /><br />Since writing the above, I've bought a TP-LINK Powerline Nano adapter kit and hooked up the camera directly with wireless disabled. What a difference! The camera has not dropped off the network even once in the last month! We had a neighborhood power outage from a storm for a few hours and the camera came up with the power, connected and capturing images. It was as if the power outage hadn't happened.<br /><br />My conclusion is that unless you have a very strong wireless signal with no interfering neighbors or static, you might consider either running a wire, or adding a powerline network. This camera has been running for about two and a half years now and is still doing great -- as long as it's connected to the network.<br /><br />---------------------------- End of update<br /><br />I installed an FI8910W in our basement to keep an eye on our colony of three rescued cats. I'm a software and network engineer so I had no problem getting it working. Also, I carefully read the manual and instructions on the foscam.us site and found them accurate and complete.<br /><br />I'm using the built-in motion detector to capture images when there's activity and send them to my web site. We get about 1,000-2,000 pictures every day to review, but we run through them quickly in a couple of minutes, which makes the motion look like an old Charlie Chaplin movie. And we can stop and review any time while doing that.<br /><br />There's plenty of control over the duration and timing of the motion capture process, and the built-in FTP client works quickly in sending the images. Each capture is about 35 kB in size and 640x480 in dimension.<br /><br />The room is about 25 feet square and the 640x480 picture looks good, but if you blow it up for detail you soon lose resolution and it's hard to make out small features. But for 640x480 it looks quite good. The resolution is a bit better during bright daylight conditions, but the infra-red night vision is still good. It auto-switches when the light fades, and it's a bit dark just before the switch. The infra-red system lights up the far wall at 25 feet with no problem and covers the entire area of view. The night-vision picture is black and white, where the daylight picture contains goodcolor.<br /><br />The cats' eyes don't react to the infra-red, they can't see it, so their pupils are wide open and they  look like little very bright headlights on a clearly visible black-and-white picture. We all know cats do well in the dark, but it's amazing to see just how comfortable they are. The seem to see everything and can run and play just as well in dark as in light.<br /><br />I've built a web page that displays the video to make it easy for others to view, and I get great comments with it.<br /><br />There are a lot of good 3rd-party programs that are easier to use and present the streaming video better, both on desktops and in Android and iOS portable systems. But the server in the camera is quite usable if you don't want to get fancy.<br /><br />You can set up the camera to accept logins at three levels, administrator, operator, and user. The user can only watch, the operator can pan and tilt the camera, and the administrator has full control. This is all built into the camera's firmware.<br /><br />As for reliability, the camera is on 24/7 and runs without a hitch for long periods. Every week or so, however, it drops off our network for some reason and I need to go down and reboot it by recycling the AC power. I don't think this is a flaw in the camera but in our network or ISP, but I can't find the cause.<br /><br />Making substantial changes to the configuration is easy, but forces a re-boot of the camera. You can, however, set it up so that after every re-boot the camera will return to a specific position. This makes maintenance very easy.<br /><br />My router allows dynamic domain name service, and I use a free service so the video can be seen from anywhere. That allows my web page to pick it up easily, and I can look in from anywhere with my phone, ebook reader, and tablets.<br /><br />I looked at a number of other cameras and carefully read the reviews, specifications, and went to the company web sites. In my opinion, I'd say this Foscam FI8910W is the best and most versatile camera for the money. You'll need a little computer expertise or a good ability to follow directions carefully, or a good friend to get it set up.

I have an F18918W I purchased 1.5 years ago and recently purchased the newer model F18910W. Although the 8918 has done a fine job and the picture is very sharp and clear, it did not render color very well. Most greens showed up as purple due to the IR function. The night viewing on both cameras is fantastic with automatic IR functioning as the light becomes too low. The new 8910 has corrected this problem perfectly! All colors in daylight render perfectly! Greens are green, reds are red and blues are blue. The user interface is very robust and allows many functions, too many to list. It also works wireless as well as it does with a wired connection. I have an Android phone app (There are many to choose from)which allows me to view both cameras from my phone, this feature too works perfectly. I would suggest that sending the image over the internet to be viewed on any computer is slightly complex for one who is not computer/router knowledgable. This is where Mr. Jees from Foscam comes in. If you call product support and speek to him he will walk you through the setup and you will be up and runninng in no time. Of course there are higher quality cameras and systems avaliable, but I muust say for the price of this camera (which is really a system in itself) you can't do any better!",26-06-2012

I monitor it with an IPhone app, and I found that easy to set up. I would like more detailed documentation sent with the camera.<br /><br />I was having a problem with it always changing my IP, so I called customer support at Foscam, spoke to Sean, and I had a very successful interaction with him... he answered all of my questions (I had three).<br /><br />(1) I was not able to set all of the settings through Safari, and he helped me adjust the Internet Explorer settings, so I could go into Administrator Use (only visable on IE)... on the camera and set the storage location for my pictures and videos.<br />(2) He also had me change a setting so now I no longer have a dynamic IP, and I don't have to constantly reset my iPhone app.<br />(3) He was also able to guide me through the setting that has the camera return to the preset location after reboot... It would reboot, then not return to the location I had preset for the camera...but it is set now.<br /><br />My experience with Sean and customer support was very positive.  He guided me through the settings that I needed, and I would not hesitate to call again...  I am using the camera to see what wildlife are devouring my tomato plants!

Our Foscam cameras (wireless versions  indoor and outdoor) are wonderful for helping us keep track of our 3 small children during the day while we are at work.

Under $100 for each camera, with LED/night-time technology and even a \\""talk back\\"" feature - the cost is much less than baby montiors we looked at purchasing.  The best part - we can view these cameras from our brower, our office/home computers, our ipad and even the iphone!  Set up took some time, but the technician was knowledgable, patient and walked me through it (I'm pretty computer illiterate).  After initial set up I am able to view the wireless cameras via phone/tablet or computer.  As a mom, I couldn't be happier!

I made numerous calls over a 40 minute period with the phone ringing with no answer.  Finally, I reached a person by the name of Steve.  Once I got a hold of him he was EXTREMELY helpful.

The 2-year warranty is definitely worth purchasing it directly from the manufacturer.<br /><br />The not so good:  Would be the icing on the cake, if the camera had a zoom function. This should be standard on any security cam. Secondly, certain features (recording function, audio and split screen for multiple cams) only work with IE and not Safari (Mac).

I'm not that knowledgeable when it comes to networking and especially port forwarding so it took me awhile to get this thing up and running the way I intended. (Approx 2 hours) As others have said the directions are lacking.<br /><br />I have it hooked up now to my WiFi and also have it setup so I can access it via the web from anywhere. I can see a ton of uses for this thing from security, pets, kids, elderly, etc.<br /><br />Has a good picture, very good color, 2-way audio is cool but I've found that only works when using IE. I like the motion alarm settings and being able to have it send an email containing a series of stills. (Although I did end up with 60 emails the first morning since I managed to get wind chimes in the picture when I set it up the night before!) The IR works really nice indoors but keep in mind that if you have it set up to look out a window at night the IR will just cause a bright reflection in the glass and you won't be able to see anything.<br /><br />I had the camera setup very quickly on my LAN but had troubles when it came to following the directions for accessing via the web. The directions point you to a DNS service (which I understand) but I couldn't find where I could set up a free account as the directions implied.....so finally after about an hour of searching I came across this:[...] After watching this guys videos on his setup I went with no-ip.org and got everything set up for access via the web real quickly after that.<br /><br />This is where my one complaint comes from. If Foscam is directing you use a particular DNS service then they really should provide better support on their website and be proactive in letting customers know where to  turn or do instructional videos similar to the guy I found on Youtube (Props to him!)",11-06-2012

I didn't want a camera that needed a lot of wires to hook up and could be placed anywhere in the house.  There is an instruction manual that comes with the camera.  I followed those instructions exactly.  However, the camera did not work remotely.  After a little help from my brother, I found that I had to make sure the port numbers all matched up (in the single port fowarding on my router and Basic network settings on the camera setup) and that the IP address for the camera was correct (I had to look this up on my router settings).  Once I figured those out, the system worked perfectly and I use the IP Cam viewer app on my Android phone to view it.  All I have to do is have an outlet to plug the camera in and I can put it anywhere.  I love this so much that I am purchasing 3 more for my house.

This convinced me to finally call the software support.  The customer support was outstanding!  Within minutes Ralph had me up and running perfectly.

Tech support was excellent too - thanks to Anzen Dcruz.<br /><br />Tech Issue: If you have a VoIP box (Allvoi, Vonage etc) in between modem and router, the port forwarding won't work. Unless port forwarding works, you won't remote access to the camera from outside your home WAN network.<br /><br />Solution: Remove the VoIP box and connect model directly to the router. Once remote access is working, connect the VoIP box to the router (i.e. ethernet cable from router to your VoIP instrument for the internet phone to work as well).",04-06-2012

Each has its strengths.<br />The advantages of the Foscam are:<br /><br />1-Great range of motion - 270 degrees L and R.<br />2-Decent IR night vision out to 25 feet or so. Works in complete darkness.<br />3-Microphone feature so you can talk (and listen) through its speakers. Panasonic can only listen-no mike.<br />4-Relatively easy setup.<br />5-Good prices available.<br /><br />Disadvantages of the Foscam:<br /><br />1-No internal memory to store images/video. Panasonic can store 400 or more frames of motion triggered frames to its internal memory for playback any time via cellphone, computer, etc. Only options with the Foscam are emailing the images or uploading them to an FTP site (the Panasonic also allows these 2 options). If you have multiple cameras, uploading these streams can put a serious hit on your broadband performance.<br /><br />2-No provided free DNS service for dynamic IP users. You have to purchase a yearly subscription to dyndns.com in order to keep your dynamic IP address changes up to date automatically - a must if you are accessing the camera remotely and do not want to keep a computer running at the camera site. Panasonic provides its own free DNS service with its cameras. Either DNS service works fine, but Panasonic's is free and comes with the camera.<br /><br />3-Although the settings options available on the Foscam are adequate, the options you can set on Panasonic are much more extensive (especailly with respect to alarm trigger settings). Of course, this can make the Panasonic a little more daunting to set up for novice users.<br /><br />Conclusions: I like both cameras, but for security where night vision and range of motion are important, for my applications, the Foscam wins.",03-06-2012

There are other vendors with less expensive products if you don't need the two way audio and the two way audio on the Foscam is horrible (actually doesn't work). The microphone on the Foscam works, but there is a lot of static when you use the camera wirelessly. The speaker in the camera is totally unworkable for me so far and I work with computer technology for a living. To make matters worse, their technical support is horrendous. I work in technical support myself, so I sent them a very detailed email outlining the audio problems I was encountering and everything I had tried to remedy the problem. I got back a three line email suggesting obvious things that had they read my email they would've known weren't applicable or I had already tried them. Moreover in their reply, they told me that there was no problem with my camera and it must be something else. How the lazy support technician could unilaterally decide that my camera wasn't possibly broken, was an amazing display of ignorance on their part. Although it is possible that the unit I got is defective, I now am more convinced that it is a flawed product design. I determined that by digging on the internet and found out that these audio problems have been discussed many times, including in Foscam's own technical forum's yet the Foscam technical support people claimed ignorance that the problems even exist. I've since seen posts going back over more than a year talking about these problems in various Foscam models. So I have the camera up and running and as far as a the video goes it works fine, but I've had to accept the fact that there will be no two way audio. Being in the computer industry myself, I know technology like this can have its quirks and require some work to run smoothly. So the fact that the audio didn't work out of the box as advertised didn't bother me nearly as much as the crappy support from the company did. Moreover,from what I read on Foscam's own technical forum, it appears as though there is no solution for this problem. So now I must buy another camera for the two way audio application I needed and it WON'T be a Foscam.",01-06-2012

I'm not computer illiterate, have a EE masters and after many hours of dealing with my ISP and my WIFI router tech support I failed.  Port forwarding is required for this camera to work over the internet.  Most ISP's dymanically assign IP addresses which then requires the services of a website to \\""track\\"" your IP address.  Getting the house of cards through my router and modem (which also has a router embedded)resulted in a less than reliable connection to the camera from the internet.  Within my home network the camera worked fine.  Foscam's tech support was absolutely no, zero, help.  Many many hours and much frustration later, I punted.<br />This product has the potential to be great......if Foscam set up a free server like DropCam.

The unit has ethernet, wifi, power and audio in/out jacks(3.5mm.)<br /><br />Install was quick and easy. Plug the ethernet into my router and once I found the IP I was on the admin page. No disc required. Connecting to my wifi was a little funny, at first it didn't find my network. I think it may have been something to do with all the wireless access points near me. It eventually did after refreshing one more time and I was connected without wires.<br /><br />The web interface is pretty simplistic. Admin options, set a password, FTP upload etc. It serves its purpose and is fine.<br /><br />The picture quality is great. Its way better than my 8 year old Logitech webcam. Surprisingly the inferred works great too. It turns on automatically. The pan and tilt moves somewhat jerkingly but functions just fine. To make up for that it's super quiet. I can't even hear it when it moves. The image quality...pretty darn good!<br /><br />The audio doesn't work on my mac. They say install the VLC plug-in. Wrong, search some more, people are reporting the VLC plug-in does not work. I found this to be the case. I can get the audio to stream over VLC itself, but not two-way as advertised. I guess I'll try the two way audio from work on my PC.<br /><br />The cam works great with pretty well with webcamXP. Put in the IP and your credentials and the devices is added to your camera pool. The only issue I have found is you cannot inverse the pan/tilt controls which would come in handy as my camera is mounted upside down.<br /><br />Now of course to get this viewable from the web you will need to setup the correct port mappings to your device.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy with this device. I kind of wish it had a zoom but for the price It's supoer neat! I hope the Mr. Derp doesn't mind me checking up on him!/><br />Overall I'm happy with this device.

I am good with electronics but not so much with computers and after going through the tutorial (which is actually pretty good) but with not much success I decided to have them install the two for me.  I spoke with Smith and he was very patient.  There was a software glitch which I never would have been able to figure out.  He set them up so they can be viewed through the internet and alert me when anyone enters my house.  They can be setup with or without audio and also the motion sensitivity. Good customer service is also a plus.,17-05-2012

I wanted to have night vision capability so I tried the Foscam F18910W.  It's OK.  Only a couple of features are better than the Panasonic's.  First is that the Foscam has night vision which uses infra red LEDs for a light source and it' can be turned off.  Second is that the PTZ has a greater range.  It didn't take me long to get the cam setup but I have a lot of experience doing that sort of thing.  Some of the instructions were a bit cryptic in the manual as were some of the setting labels from the camera itself.<br /><br />With brand \\""P\\"" you can determine how many images are FTP'd before and after a trigger (motion) event so that you can see what triggered it.  You don't have that capability with these.  With brand \\""P\\"" you can FTP images  on a timer schedule (say every 10 minutes).  You can't with these.  Your limited to the port numbers you can use, do not go above port number 32767 if you want to view more than one camera in an IE browser page using the multi-device settings.<br /><br />There are more differences which brand \\""P\\"" is better and has more flexibility.<br /><br />All-in-all the Foscam is not a bad camera and depending on how your going to be using it it may be fine for you.  For what I wanted (night vision) it does well but these are not my primary cams, for that I'll stick with brand \\""P\\"".",16-05-2012

These work reasonably well with decent image quality given that its only 640x480.  The web interface is pretty typical and resembles that of all other IP cameras I've used.  PTZ controls are ok, but really wish you could adjust the movement speed on the view page itself without having to go into separate configuration pages.  It can be difficult to make fine position adjustments (such as for setting the position memories) except in lower speeds but can be annoying waiting for a lower speed to pan a great distance.  The camera resets itself occasionally but seems to always come back up within a few seconds and has been fairly reliable for 24x7 usage.  This Foscam FI8910W is extremely similar to the Foscam FI8918W.  Other than the slightly nicer external housing with matte finish I don't see any real difference between the two except that this one is quite a bit more expensive.

The free DynDns account (I have a dynamic IP address) allows access from any computer and using the Foscam app on my HTC EVO (Andriod) phone works great. There is a slight delay panning the camera remotely from computer or phone but that is a function of my slow (3meg) internet connection at home and not the camera's fault.

I purchased the camera directly from Foscam because I wanted the full support and not the problems with support that I had read about here on Amazon.  I have a Motorola NVG510 cable modem and thought there might be a problem with setup.  I let Foscam support wirelessly control my PC (they did not charge me, and I stated that I did not want to pay $40.00 for their help) to set up the camera and watched what settings were changed.  I had tried to set up the camera myself and I did it all correctly except for changing one setting which was enabling TCP for the camera, not both if you aren't sure.  The way to set this up using the NVG510 is to create a NAT gaming profile labeled \\""Foscam\\"" and use port 8090 then host that port which leaves it open.  You need to be outside of your own network in order to see it at the address which is your fixed IP address and the port number that you have opened for the camera.  You don't need a DynDNS if you have the NVG510 and AT&T U-Verse, it is a static connection that doesn't change - it is always the same IP address - just write down the number for future reference.  There isn't any support for the Motorola cable modem from AT&T and people make a much bigger deal out of setting this up because there isn't accurate information available.  You don't need a separate LAN or ethernet or any more network equipment.<br /><br />Now, for the review of the camera itself:  it doesn't seem to work properly at all other than being a remote viewing device.  It takes pictures when there isn't any motion, and most of the time when there is motion it doesn't take pictures at all.  When I turn my light on in the living room, the camera comes to life and starts clicking and taking pictures.  In reviewing the snapshots e-mailed to me, a lot of them are empty of any persons (me) walking by it.  The sensitivity setting is on 10 which is the setting the Foscam rep set it at.  I left it on that setting because I don't have any animals or children that might trigger it.  When I was away and accessed the camera over the internet, I could not get it to pan around unless I used the horizontal or vertical patrol function.  So I am almost wishing at this point that I had not purchased this camera.  I might change this review after I work with it a bit longer, but it seemed to be working at first now it works when it feels like it.  I will try rebooting it frequently to see if that makes a difference.<br /><br />The picture quality is very good and clear, the color is what you would expect from a camera of this price - I am not making a movie so the colors don't need to be perfect - they are very close and the light blue walls and pictures are the right colors.  I was able to look around my living room and see that my stereo and TV were still there which made me feel less anxious while I was away from home for a week.<br /><br />However, I am not happy at all with the fact that the camera is not reliable at all for the motion detection function which is a major reason I purchased it.",05-05-2012

It came within a week as promised. I wasn't there to receive the package, the delivery guy called me and said he would come back the next day and he did. He came at 7:30 am to make sure I got it before work. I'm in IT but I was torn between the reviews on here. Some people saying it was extremely easy to setup and some people claiming to  be IT experts that took 4 days to set it up. I gathered all of my resources together (paper manual, foscam website instructions, the pdf instructions from Foscam, and the Amazon reviews) and proceeded with caution. It took me about an hour to setup but if I did one now it would take 5 mins. If you have ever messed around with a router configuration and you know how to follow written instructions, then you'll be able to setup this camera. I did NOT have to subscribe to any ddns website or any of that crap. If you follow the instructions under support on Foscam's site, step by step, you will be good. Also, download the PDF instructions from Foscam, the paper manual started off good but then progressed into broken English. The website instructions seemed to be written better and had screen shots. The first 2 parts of setup were extremely easy. Plug the camera into the router and power (cables included), Install the software and open it up. The camera's IP is listed there. At first it didn't work but Windows prompted me to install an Active X control, once I did I got video. The \\""hard\\"" part of setting it up to access from the outside world, just took some sniffing around. Their site has instructions for all the big name routers but I have a no name Zytel that they didnt have instructions for. I followed the instructions, they said \\""Go through the options on your router until you find an option that says \\""Virtual Server\\"", \\""Port Forwarding\\"", or \\""Port Mapping\\"" mine happened to be under \\""NAT\\"" on my router. I used the screenshot as a reference and went through every setting on my router until I found something that looked like the screenshot. You set the camera to use a port other than 80 (they suggest 8090), and then in the router, you enter the camera's ip address and port that you're using (ingoing and outgoing the same). At first this wasn't working for me, but then I noticed that my router was UPnP ready but the camera UPnP setting was unchecked, so I checked it and it worked! So once this is setup, you go to whatsmyip.com and find out the IP of your modem. Once you have your WAN ip you can type it with the port from anywhere in the world to connect to your camera (eg 63.63.10.1:8090. The camera also has a setting that will email you the IP if it changes! I have a Droid so I went right into the app store and surprisingly there are a bunch of free apps that you can use, and they work! The infared night vision works really well, I've been seeing white orbs dancing around my apt in the dark (not crazy, I took video of it) not sure what that is all about. I just started messing with the audio, it's not the best in the world but it works and it's $100 camera. I'm still messing with the settings and I can keep going all night but I highly suggest this camera. It has more functions than cameras that cost 3 times as much (from what I read).

He has the older FI18918W model and i wanted to add security cameras to my house. I ended up getting this model since it is the newest model with a new IR-cut filter. Setting up the camera for wired and wireless was pretty easy but getting access from outside of your network was a little confusing. DYNDNS and port forwarding were foreign to me and i had to google a lot of stuff to set that part up. You need to sign up for DYNDNS.ORG (14 day free trial) then cancel before the 14 days and you get to keep and use 1 domain name for free. Functions of this camera is good for the price. I would even pay a little more if they would increase the camera resolution. Night vision and motion sensor with email notification is awesome. Email notifications also include 5-6 snapshots of when motion was detected. My friend with the older model saw my camera video and said that the colors are better than the older model so he ordered 2 new cameras. I liked mine so much that i ordered another camera also.

They have excellent reviews, aren't extremely hard to setup up given the plethora of web information, and for the most part function as claimed.  3 major problems, which would lead me to NEVER buy another Foscam camera: 1) the audio on all 4 are terrible - there is absolutley no way you could solely use these cameras as a baby monitor  2) the wifi reception is so poor it is impossible to rely on.  One minute they are working very well, the next you can't connect to them.  This issue is only resolved when you unplug the camera to reset (which is useless if you aren't home or don't want to sneak into your child's room).  I've tried the larger antena, eventually replaced my router and even added 3 access points with no real change.  The only solution the company gave me was to use them wired.  These leads to the biggest problem 3) The support has been TERRIBLE, even though I paid extra to get them from the true Foscam DLL company.  Technical support is in India and their only explanation for problems was to blame my router.  One camera was clearly defective with a dead pixel line and it was apparently still the router's fault.  Numerous phone calls after many failed \\""we will call you back in 2 hours\\"" resulted in them finally issuing an RMA# (note there is no RMA process detailed on the foscam website), and I still had to call almost daily to see when they were going to ship the replacement camera to me.  2 months later and finally the replacement has appeared, but they are still holding out on reimbursing the defective camera's shipping cost as they had promissed.  You can tell a company has no interest in support when they give you random names as reference for the calls - I'm referring to you Robert/Jake/Charles - the exact same support person in India (yes I've had to call them that many times!)",20-04-2012

I was just hoping for more for the price. You're basically paying a premium for the fact that it is a wireless, motorized camera - NOT because of the camera's performance or picture! If you say \\""but that's cheap for such a camera!\\"" then you need to understand the shortcomings - especially when you can buy a 4-camera setup WITH DVR for under $200 nowadays - same resolution and with NV too! Maybe if I had used this camera for a different purpose than security monitoring I would have felt differently...<br /><br />The setup went well, and within a few minutes I was up and running. Had to reset the camera a couple times to get it recognized, which the manual does not mention to do. The interface? Dated. A little clumsy. NO DVR or motion capture of any sort (not even as a snapshot). They want you to buy separate Blue Iris monitoring software, which is an added expense. I could not find any other software to work with this camera for DVR monitoring, and the Blue Iris is...not the best.<br /><br />Want to monitor the camera from over the internet? Good luck! First you need to register a domain - I used [...] which is free. If you've never setup a domain before this step can be confusing, and then the real fun begins when you try and setup your router and camera for remote access. Built computers before? Pretty good at software? Then try your skills with this setup! And then? You don't get streaming video on your phone. Just snapshots. Maybe I did it wrong - I will be the first to admit it. But man, this camera was hard as HELL to setup for remote access, and really not worth the effort.<br /><br />Night vision? Works great. Indoors. Only indoors. If you use this for a nanny cam, or maybe for watching an entryway, it would work well. The ability to pan and scan is great, and the ability to look around a room is cool as hell.<br /><br />Want to use it outdoors? Forget it. The camera is obviously not weatherproof, so you have to have it looking out through a window. The problem with this, and with any other NV camera, is the infrared emitters reflect back off the glass, effectively blinding the camera! All you see is a white picture, like looking into a constant camera flash. It works ok if you open the window and look through the screen, although here in the northeast that means about half the year you can't leave that window open, so for half a year you don't have night vision.<br /><br />NV distance. They state up to 8m, which I believe is accurate. That's around 25 feet, at the edge of which you really can't see past. This means the effective range for any kind of detail with the NV is maybe 10 feet - just enough to see something or someone that is directly in front of the camera. You were hoping it would kind of lighten up the yard/driveway/whatever, so you can kind of see the whole thing? Like it is a moonlit night? No way. Not happening. Buy a separate infrared emitter system. But then that brings up...<br /><br />Picture quality. When I first started using the camera I was impressed! The filter does a good job of fixing color issues, and the picture is clear and colorful. BUT you gotta remember that this camera is 640x480, and you WILL NOT be able to make out details. Even up close. Not kidding. Oh sure, you will be able to tell what make of car that is, or be able to tell who that person you've seen before is, but if you want a license number, or a clear description of a person other than \\""a guy\\"" then this resolution is not for you. If you say \\""but that's a good resolution for a camera in this price range!\\"" then why can I buy a $30 camera that has the same resolution? Why is it webcams come in 1280x720 or higher, for less money? Yeah yeah yeah pick apart my argument, I still think if you need a security camera then you need a higher resolution.<br /><br />Problems with the unit. I had this mounted in my kitchen window looking out at the yard, so I could see who is walking up to thehouse. Even though the camera was behind the blinds (which were closed) and facing out, every time the kitchen light is on there is enough ambient light to hit the sensor and turn off the NV at night. If someone is outside when the light is on, I won't know it, so I only have NV if nobody is in the kitchen at night. I feel the sensor is too sensitive. Then, at least with my unit, the camera would reset by itself several times a day. Caused by router dropouts? Power surges? Who can say! All I know is it would stop working, and it would pan/tilt constantly - almost as if it had been just turned on - except it won't stop moving until it is rebooted. Finally - and this complaint might be for any wireless camera - my router would get overloaded trying to keep up with the stream from the camera, and my overall internet speed would drop to near nothing. As soon as I would switch off the camera everything would go back to normal.<br /><br />I have had the camera for about a month and a half before writing this review, but within the first month (and after having it shut down and reset itself as I mentioned above about 100 times) I said enough is enough. I asked for an RMA. I was told \\""no RMA's unless you call tech support and it is needed\\"". Wow. In an age where most major retailers take returns no questions asked, and since I feel like I have had a legitimately bad experience, I was not expecting this. The camera was not purchased from Amazon, rather from one of their resellers, and I feel this is bad customer service. This isn't a complaint about the camera itself, but instead a warning to make sure you buy from someone you can deal with easily - especially since the price I paid is the same as if I bought it from Foscam!<br /><br />Worth it? Maybe. Think what you will use it for first.",09-04-2012

In general, I have been pleased.  But it is a very steep climb, to learn to use the thing.  More than one reviewer has said it takes a networking expert to get it to work.  And I guess I agree that it would take an expert to get everything working correctly.  The manual(s) is/are pretty miserable.  Yet the camera appears (at least) to be a fine piece of equipment.  This is what I have and have not been able to make work correctly:  I can view my project from 100 miles via the internet, and I can traverse the camera up, down, and sideways remotely.  The IR works great in the dark, if you want to watch your cat prowl around.  I can record to a hard drive, but it is unreliable over longer periods of time.  It often just quits recording, for reasons unknown.  Sometime it records for hours.  Sometimes it quits after a few minutes.  Sometimes the camera resets itself and goes through some sort of test cycle, for no apparent reason - halting the recording.  Sometimes it changes its local IP address and can't be reset remotely. I have not found the motion detection feature to be useful.  If you set it to not detect water ripples or trees moving, it misses important action.  It will send you an email, if motion is detected.  So I imagine this could work well, if the background were totally motionless, such as interior monitoring.  At some point it quit working with passwords.  I haven't gotten the \\""patrol\\"" features to work right.  The function to \\""remember\\"" and return to fixed positions has never worked.  I have a feeling that, with a great manual, it would be a great camera.  But I have reached my limit, having gotten it to do just a few basic things, sort of correctly.  To use it \\""remotely\\"" you must open a port through your fire wall.  I don't know how hazardous this is, so I am careful to remove all computers from the network while the port is open. I seem to have a \\""sticky\\"" IP address, so I have not bothered to get a fixed IP from my ISP, or do that other thing the manual attempts to explain.  So far, no problem.  I feel that this would be a fantastic gadget, able to do all sorts of useful things, if the software and manual were just a little better.<br /><br />OK, a year or so later...  I have learned that I should set the local IP address to some value higher than 100, such as 101 or 102, etc.  My WIFI router reserves the right to mess with any IP lower than 100.  This may vary from router to router.  Once I set the IP address to 101, I had no problem having the camera go off line.  I have also bought 3 more cameras of the lower price Wansview variety.  The video quality and internal software are not quite as nice, but they are fine for my purchases.  For reasons unknown, the Wansview cameras are a little quicker to respond remotely.  In general, I have been happy with both models, but they take considerable playing around to get them working.<br /><br />Oh, yes, and as I note in the other review, the Wansview camera comes with a totally blank software disc.  So it helped me to have the disc from my Foscam camera.",09-04-2012

It actually was not that hard... you just have to pay attention to what you are doing.  Ill give you some advice. When they tell you to do \\""port forwarding\\"", do not use the \\""range\\"" option...... do each one indiviudaly. so in your router you will put in the ip address of the cam, then assign a port number. 8090 is a good place to start. So your cam will then be something like this if you are within network. 192.168.1.125:8090.  If outside, you need to get your router ip addess then the port number. So something like this.

Pic is clear day and night although the color is a little weak, however it does have auto iris control which is great cuz it adjusts instantly to bright light or shade. I have had mine outside under eaves for over 6 months with 0 problems.  Oh and i almost forgot. You can talk through them and listen to feedback which is great. No extra speakers or anything required. This is priceless... especially when the kids are outside doing something they shouldnt be!!!

I have two Panasonic IP cameras that I've used for over 5 years. They still work perfectly, but they lack night vision. They're also wired cameras, and I wanted a wireless unit for some locations where I don't have an Ethernet jack conveniently located.<br /><br />I'm not sure how sturdy this is. I guess time will tell. The pan / tilt has a little play, and I'm not sure what would happen if I were to force it to move when powered off. Needless to say I'm unwilling to subject my new toy to destructive testing.<br /><br />The black surface has a soft, velvety feel to it, not the slick smooth plastic I was expecting. I hope it won't be a dust magnet. Time will tell.<br /><br />The package came with the camera, a mounting bracket with screws and drywall anchor, an Ethernet cable, the antenna (detached, attaching it takes about 5 seconds), power supply, a CD and two sheets of quick start guide (MacOS and Windows). The CD contains the reference manual and quick start guide (MS Word format), an installation video, and the IP Camera Utility.<br /><br />I plugged everything in, fired up the IP Camera install (which required me to reboot my Windows box), and it did not detect my camera. No matter. I fired up Fing on my Android tablet, which quickly found the camera. Some routers can tell you what devices are on your network as well. Armed with the IP address, I connect to it and I'm greeted by the login page. I'm using Firefox at this point.<br /><br />Just about every configuration change, including adding user, or changing password, requires the camera to reboot. This is silly, but I can live with that. Once everything is set up, I won't be changing configurations every day.<br /><br />There are 3 types of user accounts : administrator, operator, and visitor. Visitors cannot change the pan / tilt setting, but they can switch on audio (listen, talk, or both). Operators can do everything a visitor can, as well as control the camera. An administrator can change the configuration of the camera.<br /><br />This is where I ran into my first problem with Firefox. In Firefox, I can listen to what the camera picks up, but I cannot speak through the camera. I also don't see Visitor settings that I see in Internet Explorer - turning on the On Screen Display (date / time) and other such settings.<br /><br />An Operator can turn the IR on or off, but you have no control over the IR Cut Filter. There's a very audible click as it cuts in or out. If you happen to position the light just so, with IR turned on, you can hear it cut in and out every few seconds.<br /><br />The audio is not great - there is a fair bit of static, but I can make out speech if the speaker talks slowly. It's probably more useful for picking up noise than for use as an intercom.<br /><br />Testing within my home LAN, there is very little delay (less than 0.2 seconds) with audio turned off. When audio is turned on, both video and audio is delayed by about 1.5 seconds. Speaking through the camera (sending my voice from browser to camera), my voice is delayed by less than 1 second (probably around 0.6 seconds).<br /><br />Picture quality is good, considering that it is 640 x 480 and not HD. Audio is OK, movement is rather silent. The frequent reboots during configuration, flaky IP Camera Tool (not needed if you know how to get the IP of the camera by other means), and the missing features in Firefox is why I took away 1 star from my rating. Hopefully the Firefox and reboot issues will be fixed by future firmware releases. As of April 1st 2012, there is no firmware updates available for this camera.<br /><br />I couldn't edit my seller feedback, so I'm including the information here.<br /><br />PhotoPLUS was not listed as an official reseller on Foscam's website, so I sent them an email. They confirmed that PhotoPLUS is indeed an authorized reseller.",02-04-2012

Overlooked the numerous online feedback on wifi issues.  Found out the hard way that wifi is very problematic.  Initially connected the camera via wifi but after disconnecting it for relocation, the camera refuses to connect via wifi.  A very tech savvy person with solid network background, I have tried every single option both on the camera and via multiple routers and my experience is the same as most others online.  After 4 days of trying to connect via wifi, I gave up and ran a wire to the camera instead.  The wired connection works and despite my woes with wifi, this camera, once it holds up, is a good buy compared to many other options out there.  I'm not a fan of CMOS cameras but this one looks just as great as my CCD ones.  Downloaded FoscamPro for iphone and everything works generally well except for an occasional audio distortion.  Overall, I'm happy with this camera for the build, features, and functionality at such a low cost despite the wifi issues.  If you are looking for a wifi camera, forget this one, otherwise it is a great deal as a wired camera.

This is the biggest PLUS in that many of these cams have to be tweaked to cooperate with Apple......<br /><br />Advice: Ignore the printed instruction manual and go to the Foscam website which is 10X more concise and well written...although I was able to use the printed instructions, the website is far better and less intimidating.<br /><br />I am in the process now of inputing settings to allow my to see the cam from outside of the house......the website, while asking that you understand some IP terminology, also gives links to various sites for setting up your own domain name which is required.....<br /><br />Customer Support, off the website, is there if needed.......all in all, I love the cam and will add at least one more to our home for cat monitoring....<br /><br />UPDATE: I just set the cam up using the \\""port forwarding\\"" instructions from the Foscam website and the performance is fantastic....really not that bad to do the install once the domain name was set up and the online instructions were pretty straight forward, far better than those in the print copy included in the box.<br /><br />Bottom line: you cannot go wrong with Foscam.

They now connect to a P2P network and send your data to the Chinese company that makes them. This model does not, just the new ones, but fair warning seems necessary.    [...]    I would rate this camera as medium to somewhat difficult to install. This from someone who has been a computer tech for close to 30 years.    The first thing I figured out was that I needed to print out the manual that comes on the CD. The quick install pamphlet is good, but limited. You do need both to install the camera.    One thing that they tell you to do is go to [...] and get a free domain name to use when you connect remotely. The problem is that company doesn't provide free domain names. The other options for domain names given in a list they provide in the software seem to be non-existent. At least I think that's what they're telling me... It's confusing and poorly explained.    I'm currently connecting with the IP address, and it has worked from a location outside my internal network. I'm going to try using our domain supplied by Microsoft for our Windows Home Server. [...]. If it works, I'm set. If not, I'm looking for a place to get one. I'm not overly interested in purchasing a domain name just for the cameras. Of course if the IP address works consistently I don't have to.    Their port forwarding screen and explanation are confusing, but it's port forwarding so what would anyone expect? I still don't understand why every explanation I find regarding this task confuses it more than necessary.    As for the camera itself, I am very impressed. The pan and tilt range is excellent, the resolution is clear at 640x480, the color is crisp, and you can adjust the brightness and contrast. I think it has the ability to save settings based on what you choose, but I haven't tested that yet. Infrared is automatic when the light level gets low and is a clear image.    It will email alerts(it can be turned on and off easily) and I have set up and tested this feature. It works well within limits, but I can't get it to successfully send a message to my wife's Gmail account even though it sends one to mine. This feature needs a better explanation in the documentation. It attaches six snapshots to the email, and you can get a bunch of emails with constant movement! I know this because I forgot to turn it off once after testing. Oops! The picture quality in the email is excellent.    I have set up our smart phones (Android) access the camera and it works fairly well. The biggest negative is the speed of the connection, but that's the cell phone service. Picture quality is pretty good and you can control the pan, tilt etc from the phone. An app download is required. This is the one I use: IP Cam Viewer Free. There is a full version with quite a few features that are not in the free. I may be buying that one once things settle down on the PC side. $4.00    I downloaded a plugin:[...] that captures the audio and it works, but is a bit noisy. I've read that static can be caused by the wireless antenna and the power cord among other things and that experimentation should resolve the issues. I did notice that it really picked up the the tick-tock from our mantel clock.    The lack of the ability to get a domain name as explained, along with the apparent lack of concern about this on the part of Foscam, as well as the problems with sending email are the reasons for four stars instead of five.    I will be purchasing more of these cameras in spite of these problems.    Edit: I figured out the email for Gmail. There is this choice in the mail settings:    \\""Gmail only support TLS at port 465 and support STARTTLS at port 25/587.\\""    I initially used STARTTLS at port 25 and it wouldn't work. Changing it to TLS at port 465 resolved the problem.",31-03-2012

Yes, it's tricky to set-up if you have never done port-forwarding before and yes, the frame rate and resolution are both a little low, and the audio is crap, but remember that you paid less than $100 for this thing.  If you need audio, higher frame rates and better resolution, you should buy a more expensive IP camera.<br /><br />As far as setup goes, if you understand networking and port-forwarding, these are my recommendations:<br /><br />1) Do NOT install the software on the CD.<br />2) Connect the camera by Cat-5 wire to your router.<br />3) Login to your router (via browser) and find the IP address assigned to your camera.<br />4) Login to the camera at that IP address (via browser) and IMMEDIATELY turn OFF the DHCP.<br />5) Give your camera a fixed IP address on your network and fill in the subnet mask with what you normally use.<br />6) The Gateway and DNS fields should normally be the IP address of your router.<br />7) Fill in the SSID, encryption type, and share key used by your wireless network.<br />8) Pick a 4 digit number to use for the HTTP port number.  (I have no idea what \\""Network Lamp\\"" is so I left it checked.)<br />9) Disconnect the Cat-5 cable and re-boot the camera.<br />10) Re-login to the camera at the new fixed IP address to verify that everything's working.<br />11) Login to your router and set a port-forwarding entry to map to the fixed IP address and HTTP port you gave your camera.<br />12) Use the \\""What's My IP\\"" site to find your outside IP address.<br />13) Enter your outside IP address and HTTP port number into a browser and verify that you can get into the camera from outside your house.<br />14) You're done.<br /><br />UPDATE #1:<br />Under the Mail Service Settings there is a checkbox named \\""Report Internet IP by Mail\\"".

Make it wireless and accessable from outside your network, much more difficult.<br />The IP Camera Tool didn't work, but the workaround is simple once you know.<br />Just type the camera IP address into your URL search (192.168.11.144) and the Monitoring System should come right up.<br />You will need to be able to get into your router.  Again, typing this address into your URL search and it should come right up: 192.168.1.1<br />In your router, (I'll use CISCO as an example) you will need to go to the Wireless tab, Basic Wireless Settings,  and check Manual and Enable SSID Broadcast.  Wireless Security tab should be WPA2 Personal and your passphrase (password) must match the password in the camera.<br />In the Administrator tab of the Real-Time IP Camera Monitoring System you need to go to Basic Network Settings and manually type in the IP Address of the camera, and the following numbers:  Subnet Mast 255.255.255.0 Gateway 192.168.1.1 DNS Server 192.168.1.1 Http Port 80 Network Lamp (checked).  How to get the IP Address of the camera?  Here it is:  192.168.1.144.  Then Wireless LAN Settings and click the scan button and then pick your router from the list.  The SSID must match your router SSID, the Encryption is WPA2 Personal (AES) and the share key is the same as the passphrase or password of the router (above). Now, the last thing will to be set up Port Forwarding to see your wireless camera from some net connection outside of your own router.  To do this you go back into the router and find Single Port Forwarding.  In Cisco its under Gaming.  There you assign an application name, like My Cam, type 80 for the External and Internal Port, and in that line's IP Address add 144 so it reads 192.168.1.144 and Enable it by checking a box.<br />All this done, unplug the camera from the router and in your URL search type the camera's IP address and it should work:  192.168.1.144.  Outside of your network you can see it by typing your IP Address (you can get it from your router (or Google What Is My ISP) then add a colon and your port number which we above gave as 80.  So it could be:  xx.xx.xxx.xx:80.<br />What is important is that the places in your router and in the camera Administration list I've mentioned all need to be addressed and most of the numbers and i.d.s must match across the router and the camera.<br />Its a great camera.

Installation was not a problem with the exception of setting the password for the admin account. If you use certain special characters such as exclamation mark, the camera accepts your password but you can never login to the web interface again. It caused me to reset the camera back to factory settings multiple times, until I figured out the problem.<br /><br />Here are the problems I experienced:<br />- The camera locks-up after 9+ continuous hours of operation for reasons I couldn't figure out. This is a big problem if you are using the camera as a security camera. When the camera locks up, you lose the ability to see what's going on until you have physical access to the camera to reboot it by unplugging and re-plugging. Upon reset, everything comes back normal for another 9+ hours.<br />- The IR led cannot be kept OFF. You can set it off once in the UI but when the camera reboots, it goes back to the default operation, which turns on the IR led automatically in low light conditions. This is a problem if you are monitoring outside in front of a window. When the IR comes on, the reflection from the window blocks the entire view of the camera. They should have created an option to keep the IR led off.<br />- The power cable supplied is too short. If you want to put the camera high up, for example on your fireplace mantle, for a better vantage point you need an extension cord.",23-03-2012

Sadly it was too good to be true. My basic need for a surveillance camera includes the 2-way audio capability. I would not have purchased it had I known that after the past three upgrades to this product, the audio problems have yet to be addressed. This is my second try with FOSCAM, I had hoped that they had improved the audio by now. Sadly, it looks like they have greatly improved the video quality and ignored the audio problems. I guess most buyers are not concerned with audio quality as most of Amazons reviews have been good. It would help if they would state the cameras audio specifications to a level that someone who needs the 2-way capability could decide whether or not to buy this camera. It's a shame that I had to order and test the unit to find that again the audio quality was extremely poor. Talking to FOSCAM.US on this problem is like talking to a brick wall!<br /><br />PROS: video quality has greatly improved due to the addition of an IR cut filter. Otherwise the camera is much the same as earlier versions (pan, tilt, etc.) which are acceptable.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Audio reception had terrible ringing and produced 5 to 6 repeats (echo's) of everything said.<br />2. Transmission of my voice via my computer to the unit over my LAN/WAN seemed OK but weak.<br />3. When both the headset icon and the mike icon were activated simultaneously they produced a pinging and bad background noise from the cameras' speaker. This problem alone would allow anyone to locate where the surveillance camera was located.<br />4. If others have found the 2-way audio acceptable then FOSCAM has a significant quality control problem.<br /><br />  RECOMMENDATION:  I firmly believe that Amazon should discontinue selling this camera until FOSCAM can provide evidence that one of its features (2-way audio) has been corrected and now usable. Selling a product with an obvious fault as this is simply notacceptable.

So far I am sufficiently pleased that I will look into getting some more to cover more of the house.<br /><br />* Setting up the camera.<br />The camera is very easy to set up as a wifi camera, by following the written instructions and the video that comes on the installation disk.<br />The process involves plugging the camera into your router, installing the software and getting the camera recognized on the network and then unplugging the network cable and logging the camera into your wireless network. All fairly plain sailing, and this allows you to play around with the camera settings, and get used to its operation.<br /><br />Setting up the camera for web access is a little more difficult. The video on the disk is a useful primer, but the best place to go for help is foscam.us forums. In the end it took me a few hours of frustration (and reading), but I am sure this can be alleviated by considering the following points:<br />1. The DNS service at dyndns.org is no longer free, but will give a 14-day trial after which the service is $20 per year.<br />2. I am a Verizon Fios customer and it took me some time to identify that you should NOT allocate port 80 to the camera. It seems that Verizon blocks this port according to one post I read. I allocated port 8090 for this first camera and it worked fine as soon as I did this.<br />3. The Fios router is easy to set up for port-forwarding - it's a hyperlink on the main menu which takes you into the Advanced Options.<br />4. Be patient. You often have to repeat actions on the camera and allow it to reboot a few times before it will show \\""success\\"" on DNS forwarding.<br /><br />* Operating the camera.<br />There are several camera parameters that can be changed, such as picture size, frame rate, brightness and contrast. The IR works well and can be turned on and off remotely.<br />The camera has motion detection, with user sensitivity settings. When in alarm mode the camera can be set to record to your main network PC drive and also take still photos and email them directly to you.<br />The camera has 2-way audio although there is a distinct lag between network and speaker. There is some audio feedback which I managed to alleviate by rotating the camera aerial (wifi antenna) so this it faces flat. I read somewhere that this is due to the way these aerials are coiled inside the wand so that the signal is better from the sides that the wand top, which seems counter-intuitive, but my point is that you should play with the aerial (wifi antenna) position before getting too angry with it :-)<br /><br />Overall I would say this is a good buy at under $100 and gives good pictures. Now that I have set it up I shall be getting some more, so I guess that says it all. The software will allow up to 9 cameras to be connected.<br /><br />I deduct one star as I had to do a fair amount of research, and there really is no need for this. I would think this should be set up in under an hour with the right guidance.<br /><br />[Update 24 March 2012]<br />* Multiple Cameras<br />I bought a second camera and set it up on the network very easily, simply using the IP Camera Tool already installed for the first camera and even the network cable that I had left in the back of the router. Camera #2 was picked up and identified and then I added it to the wifi network as with camera #1.<br />Getting access over the internet was a bit more tricky, although once I had read through the foscam.us forum posts and started thinking properly it was fairly straightforward.<br />I assigned port 8091 to camera #2 (remember to keep away from port 80, as mentioned above) and then copied all the settings from camera #1 to camera#2 in the DDNS Server settings and Mail Service Settings menu (except port number, obviously).<br /><br />* Hint for using presets:<br />If you want to use the preset camera positions you MUST first uncheck the \\""disable preset\\"" box in the PTZ menu under Administrator. Then, if you check \\""goto preset on boot\\"" whenever the camera reboots it will start up in the preset position you last left it in. This of course assumes you have set the preset in the first place under the Operator menu (!) As an aside I don't know why they call it PTZ, as there is no zoom function on this model :-(<br /><br />* Now for the internet:<br />In the Multi-Device Settings it is important NOT to use the local IP address of the camera (e.g. 192.168.1.11) but instead use the the DDNS web address, in my case  [...], when completing the host field.<br />Once done this all works pretty well, and successfully emails me from either camera when motion is detected and records a video to my PC's HDD.<br /><br />Next step, removing the PC as video storage by either using NAS or FTP directly from the router...ept port number, obviously).<br /><br />* Hint for using presets:<br />If you want to use the preset camera positions you MUST first uncheck the \\""disable preset\\"" box in the PTZ menu under Administrator.

I had to search for directions on the Web. Expect to study up before installing, the directions it comes with are not clear. The wireless feature has to do with finding the cameras IP, your router IP and port forwarding for use on the internet. Once that's figured out the iphone apps are easy to connect to the cameras. Put time aside to get it setup and don't expect it to be easy, especially if it's your first one, only because you have to read and set it up by trial and error until it works. Finding the cameras ip was the hardest to figure out on a Mac.  The software uses your browser to make settings within the camera. The camera holds the software not your computer. There are lots of instructions on the web for when you get stuck. Once I figured everything out it works really well. I am techie and it still took me awhile to set up everything.  We are going to get an outdoor one too.  If you're use to figuring out computers then you will get all working okay but if computers are not your thing then you will need help from your techie teenager are someone that works with computers all the time.<br /><br />MAC USERS TAKE NOTE: The IP finder software on the Foscam CD that comes with the camera does not work on MAC OSX 10.6.8  even though it says it does work. You have to download and use the free program called  IPScanner to find the cameras IP. Also When you plug the camera into your Airport Extreme for the first setup, don't forget to restart your computer AND restart Airport Extreme so your computer will see the cameras IP. It took me a while to figure that out.... that was the reason why the camera's IP wasn't showing up in IPScanner software. Hope this helps someone because if I had known to restart Airport Extreme and my computer together, it would of saved me a ton of time and my hair would still be attached to my head! GEE WHIZ! I couldn't get past step 1 because of such a silly thing to RESTART both, after that everything went well.

Plug in your Foscam FI8910W IP Camera<br /><br />2. Connect your Foscam FI8910W IP Camera to your wireless router with the ethernet cord that comes in the box.<br /><br />3. Find out what IP address your camera is operating on.<br />- If you have a PC, you can get instructions for doing this here: [...]<br />- If you have a MAC, you can get instructions for doing this here: [...]<br /><br />4.

If you are having problems, follow the steps here: [...]<br />- You should now be able to disconnect the ethernet cable from the back of your camera and move the camera to the location you are going to use it at. You may have to repeat step 3 above if you are using DHCP. You probably are, so repeat step 3 and make sure you can connect into the Device Management tab wirelessly before going to step 5.<br /><br />5. Configure your Users Settings in the Foscam FI8910W IP Camera Device Management tab from your web browser.<br />- Click on Users Settings and change the admin password to something you'll remember and also add a user and password and select Visitor for the group (this is so you can let friends and family see the video without having access to change any settings).<br />- After you hit Submit, you may have to log in to your camera again with the admin information.<br /><br />6. Configure your Basic Network Settings in the Foscam FI8910W IP Camera Device Management tab from your web browser.<br />- Keep \\""Obtain IP from DHCP Server\\"" checked<br />- Change the \\""Http Port\\"" from 80 to 8000<br />- Keep \\""Network Lamp\\"" checked (unless you want to turn off the LED on the back off)<br /><br />7. Configure your Wireless Router for Port Forwarding. This essentially sets up remote access for your Foscam FI8910W IP Camera. I have a Linksys Router, so all I did was access the Linksys Router Administration Panel by going to 192.168.1.1 in my web browser and putting in my username and password. If you have a different router, the process may be similar, but you can follow the instructions for setting up port forwarding by selecting your router manufacturer on the list here: [...]<br />- In the Linksys Router Administration Panel, click on the Applications & Gaming tab and fill in these settings:<br />-- Application FOSCAM<br />-- Start 8000<br />-- End 8000<br />-- Protocol TCP<br />-- IP Address 192.168.1.111 (or the IP Address that you found the camera on earlier)<br />-- Enable check<br />- Click \\""Save Settings\\"" at the bottom of the page.<br /><br />8.

If you want to share just the video with your friends and family tell them to type in [...] to their web browser and provide them with the Visitor Username and Password you created earlier in step 5.

I tried to get it working again unseccessfully so spent the next 5 days trying again to reach them. I finally got thru, and they reset it up and then told me that it wouldn't continue to work unless I used the dyndns service because I didn't have a static IP on my router.

So I think I am pretty much the average parent wanting to put in some self-help technology and way too busy to spend hours trying to make it work.<br /><br />Out of the box the camera is really easy to set up within your home network- no problem! However when you want to set it up for monitoring from outside your home (which is really the whole point about having this camera!) that's when the \\""fun\\"" begins.<br /><br />First of all the manufacturers do not care to ship the most up to date manual with the product. Then you have to learn real fast about things like static IP address, dynamic IP, port forwarding, get a domain name from DYDNS etc etc. Don't worry calling their \\""help desk\\""- totally unhelpful and take no accountability for anything.<br /><br />I got it to work eventually, but it took me a good 4 hours over 3 days to get it working properly, and I needed a domain name (NOT FREE!).<br /><br />They could really improve this product by making it easier to set up and improve their Customer Support.",03-03-2012

Simply performs as advertised,"Lets get the bad out of the way first:<br />  Foscam's documentation is a joke.  It's terrible.  This camera will do everything they say it can, but you kind of have to figure it out for yourself.  Foscam's documentation will get you started, but that's about it.  **THEREFORE, IF YOU ARE NOT TECHNICALLY PROFICIENT OR FAMILIAR WITH BASIC NETWORK ARCHITECTURE & PROTOCOLS THE ADVANCED FEATURES OF THIS CAMERA WILL BE TOUGH FOR YOU TO SETUP.**<br /><br />On to the good:<br />  The basic stuff this camera is supposed to do - connect quickly to your wireless network, pan/tilt/zoom, capture great images in regular and little/no light at reasonable distances - just works, it's fantastic.  The applications available for viewing the video on your iOS or Android device are all over the map, more on this later, but initial setup was a breeze and, again, it just works.<br /><br />  The advanced features, such as motion sensing, the ability to email you a picture, save a picture or video stream and forward all such traffic outside your wireless LAN to the interwebs at large also just work.  These advanced features took a little while to setup and again, if you're not familiar with port forwarding and dynamic DNS hosting services then this stuff will be difficult for you.  I am an experienced user and it took me a couple hours to make it all work.  Some of that time was spent hunting around for better documentation though because, again, Foscam's documentation sucks, but once I got it, it was awesome.<br /><br />Recommended Mobile Application:<br />  THIS IS IMPORTANT so I'm surprised there is less commentary out there on which mobile app is the best.  Your mobile app is primarily how you are going to view the video stream, at least that's true for me so the app you choose affects how many of the camera's features you can enjoy.  I tried a couple but BY FAR the best one out there, at least for iOS is LiveCams Pro (available here: [...]).  A buddy of mine - a very advanced user who has an Android device - uses the same and I actually thought the Android interface was a little more robust and easier to use.<br /><br />Final Analysis:<br />  We bought this as a baby monitor but after seeing all that it will do I'm buying at least 2 or 3 more for home security purposes.  I am VERY impressed with this little thing's skills.

I couldn't get the Foscam or the DB Power camera to work on wireless because both of my wireless routers have MAC Address filtering set up. So, I took an old wireless B/G router I had lying around, I set it up without MAC Address filtering, and guess what? The wireless settings got saved and the camera worked wirelessly. The camera I tested this on was a WANSCAM PTZ camera. Also with these camera's you do not need a DDNS service to get them to work outside of your home network. You just need to set up Port Forwarding on your router. On my Trendnet router that would be on the \\""virtual server\\"" screen...very easy..<br /><br />First wireless IP Camera I bought was a DB Power, returned it because I could not get it to work on wireless. Second camera was this Foscam. I bought it based on better reviews than the DB Power, and people had success setting up the wireless. I tried for a week, read all the blogs, videos, You tube, nothing worked. I tried to do a firmware download from FOSCAM, but it never gave me the confirmation email that they said I'd get. I tried 3 times. I called FOSCAM, got redirected to call another number and got nowhere. By the way, I tried this on 2 wireless routers, a linksys wrt54g and a TP Link, even went as far as turning off all security and firewalls, still nothing. Tried all the different security variations, nothing. I am returning the camera on Monday. I think all these Pan tilt cameras are all made in China by the same company and they're all garbage. I give up. I in no way blame Amazon. I like their service. My review is strictly about the worthless camera. Oh, I should point out, if you want a WIRED camera, it's not bad. It was easy to set it up without any dns services that you have to pay for to get it to be seen across the internet, you just have to port forward the ip address and get your external IP address. That part was easy. I just refuse to pay for something that doesn't work as advertised.",26-02-2012

Enter the Foscam FI8910W.<br /><br />I didn't need anything expensive or high quality, as I'm not guarding the crown jewels.  However, the PT feature is nice to have since the viewing angle is narrow to catch my whole living room.  The image quality (640x480) is acceptable for my purposes, and that's what I expected for what I paid.<br /><br />Setup was a breeze, I didn't even install the software since you log into it through your browser (assuming your have a modicum of IT knowledge, plugging into a DHCP enabled router and discovering what the device IP is pretty simple.)  Plugged in my wifi settings, changed some of the security settings, and it lives!  Very simple, I'm not sure why there are stories of folks having so many problems.  I'm on a basic Windows based network, but I don't see why other systems would be fussy.<br /><br />I configured my Synology DS211j for a single IP camera and it worked when I claimed it was a FI8908W device.  PT works, motion detection works, I can't complain really.  I set motion capture scheduling for the hours I'm not at home so I don't have to wade through recordings of me watching TV.  (How very meta.)<br /><br />Haven't tried nighttime surveillance yet, so I can't speak for those capabilities.  Nor have I set up remote access, but I think with any device (this camera or my fileserver) it would be a bit more difficult for the uninitiated than the initial setup is.<br /><br />Bottom line: You're buying a cheap, made-in-China camera.  It isn't the most featured or highest quality.  It might not last forever.  If you're wanting something to take pictures and get them out into the internet, I can't find a better deal.<br /><br />Update:  Got my Synology configured for remote access.  DS Cam is pretty crashy on my Droid2, but when it does work I have pictures of my pooches doing whatever it is they do in the middle of the night.  The camera works great at night, the IR-cut is automatic and seems pretty good.  Again, it's not enough for CSI style \\""ENHANCE!\\"" action, but I can see who is soiling the carpet just fine.t does work I have pictures of my pooches doing whatever it is they do in the middle of the night.

Out of the box, the initial set up is easy.  Almost plug n play.  Setting up the wireless portion...not too bad.  But configuring this for remote Internet viewing, forget about it.  I dared to buy it after reading all the horror stories and took faith in the one IT guy that said it was easy.  It was the most frustrating set up I've ever encountered.  The instructions in the manual might as well be in brail.  They made little to no sense in their poorly translated English and the video on their website is even worse.  I also have a MacBook air and the firmware listed on the support page didn't work.  Luckily I had an external drive and used the cd that came with it.  With safari or chrome, there was no audio.  They refer you to another third party site to download a seperate audio add on...which doesn't work. They also direct you to a site where you create a host to view the camera remotely.  The base price is $20/year which doesn't seem like much, but it does add to the total cost.  I cancelled my hosting.  I like to think I somewhat know my way around networking ect, I easily configured my iPhone to remotely use my macs cam, but this made me feel like a rookie for sure.  So what did work? The camera worked nicley, panning/tilting almost 180 deg.  Picture was good, not great, but the ability to see in the dark was pretty cool.  Although, in low light, the camera adjust and give you the ability to turn night vision on.  But while scanning the room with it on, it you happen to catch something brighter, it becomes totally washed out.  Sound was horrible through my iPhone app ($3.99) and it made loud clicks when I turned it on and off.  I got the white one, and it looks great.  That's about it though.  Needless to say, they (I bought 2) are going right back tomorrow and I'm going to spring the extra money for a complete 4-5 camera security system with a DVR included.    UPDATE: After researching the return process, I found out that they charge a 15% restocking fee on returned items.  With companies like amazon and zappos paying for the shipping both ways, its disappointing to be penalized when making a return.  I highly discourage anyone from dealing with Fosacm and their products.  Normally, you get what you pay for philosophy would apply, but I found a company called Night Owl that has free customer set up (done remotely) to configure port forwarding and provide lifetime free ddns setup/service.  Their system is a little less than 3 foscam cameras but it includes a 500g dvr and four night vision indoor cameras.  They're wired and don't tilt/pan, but overall, a great deal.",22-02-2012

Click the camera on their website to read the disclaimer.<br /><br />This is my second camera from them.  My first camera was the 8905W and it worked fine for a year then the wireless stopped working.  I'm hoping my new camera lasts longer.<br /><br />Here is my review...<br /><br />I had the unique opportunity to see this camera in action before I purchased it and was impressed with the specs and ease of use.  It's daylight picture is fine for my needs as I only use it to cover the first floor entrance way.  It's field of view is adequate and the picture is clear enough to make out details such as objects on the floor or on the table in the other room.  It's night vision is fine for a good 20 feet, maybe a little more of complete darkness and 50+ in low light.  The wireless setup was a breeze and the web control works great.  The only reason I give this four stars is it's lack of Zoom.  This is a PT Camera ONLY.  There is no zoom and that would have made this a perfect camera for the price.  The camera has an outdoor setting that greatly improves the picture quality when viewing the outdoors.  Unfortunately this is an indoor camera but viewing through a window pane produced no noticeable glare.<br />However, viewing through the window screen blacked out the picture completely.  Night viewing through a window pane was useless as the IR LED's produced a blinding glare.  If your going to use this camera outdoor, I suggest taking the environment into account and glare through glass enclosures.<br /><br />The audio works well.  I used a stereo Mic and mini computer speakers to test it (Just wanted to see if it actually worked) as I have no real need for a permanent hook-up.  The wife just yells up the stairs anyway.<br /><br />They offer a software bundled package from the manufacturer for a better deal than purchasing both separately.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad camera for the price.deal than purchasing both separately.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad camera for the price.",16-02-2012

With that being said I felt it was very easy to set up and had the wireless and port forwarding setup in less than half an hour.

I have seen cameras with similar specs selling for much more than this so for ~ $100 bucks you cant be too picky. The quality and detail it picked up is more than adequate for what I need. The night vision was great, In a large room and very low light I was able to pick up everything in its line of sight very clearly. The one thing I noticed that I've seen on other reviews was a faint clicking noise when the IR lamps were on.<br /><br />Other Features:<br />I like that it also has a built in mic and speaker so i can pick up the sounds nearby and also transmit audio to the device. I've already freaked my wife out a few times with this. The pan tilt and zoom is great also. There are a few spots it cant rotate to and the digital zoom is just that so you lose a lot of quality when you zoom in. If you are going to be using this with a Synology Disk Station some of these features are not available through their surveillance station so be prepared for that. From the forums at Synology it looks like they are working on getting all the features enabled but it sounds like both Synology and Foscam blame each other for the things that don't work so im not holding my breath.<br /><br />Interface:<br />The built in web interface is okay.
